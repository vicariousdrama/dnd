## Day 11 (afternoon)

We are in the room we found up some stairs off of the sewers. Previously had solved a riddle to unlock a magical door.  There's a snake outside on the sewer side

#### The Plan

Matheris will open the riddle door and Jaxxen will take the lead and use Misty Vision to create teh appearance of a Baselisk.  After the door creeks open, Jaxxen decides to use an oil flask on the rusty hinges to ease the opening and closing of the door later and quiet it.  The hallway bends to the right.  Jaxxen sends the baselisk apparition ahead as far as possible. We hear the low rumble effect as before.  It's stone walls and ceiling, and there is some sand on the ground.

Jaxxen sees a door up ahead that appears to be wooden.  Its kind of flimsy and open a few inches. Opens away from the hallway into a room.  Jaxxen fires a crossbow bolt from a distance and hears nothing.  Proceeds to dismiss the Baselisk apparition and kick the door in.  Opens to a room where there are some pillars.  Jaxxen moves up to one to take cover and scope out the room.  Immediately hear a loud scream and a growl as an 8 foot tall humanoid creature gets teh drop on us. It has a giant morningstar, some armor and spikes.  Looks kind of bear like.  It attacks Jaxxen

### The Bugbear

Matheris uses his crossbow. Edwin lights a bonfire on the beast dealing some damage. Jinxia moves around Jaxxen and stabs at the creature with rapier for damage.  Jaxxen lunges toward the beast with his dagger and ends up taking fire damage from the bonfire. Alarmed at the fire, Ulysses stays back near Hereist and throws a dart but misses. Nathair rushes with his sword, hitting the beast, but takes damage from the fire. The Creature attacks Nathair doing serious damage.

Matheris gets to Nathair and heals him a bit, while suggesting we all get back into the hallway.  Edwin hits the beast with his quarterstaff. Jinxia gets close to Hereist and tries to stab the creature but misses, dropping her rapier.  Jaxxen casts Armor of Agathys attaining some temporary hitpoints and moves away to another corner of the 20 by 15 foot room.  Ulysses attacks with his quarterstaff, hitting for good damage, then follows up with critical crotch punching with a speedbag approach.  Nathair is knocked back. The creature is going for Ulysses, swings and misses.

Matheris prepares an action and will cast if everyone moves back to the passageway. Jinxia pulls out caltrops. Edwin runs with his quarterstaff but misses the beast. Jaxxen casts Chill Touch, but it backfires doing damage to himself. If not for the Armor cast in the previous round, Jaxxen would have been mortally wounded.  Ulysses the monk uses his quarterstaff but misses, attempts an unarmed bonus attack and also misses. Nathair swings his longsword, slitting the creatures gut. Its burned, bleeding, and falls down with a guteral growl.

#### Aftermath

Ulysses is curious what that creature was. Matheris thinks on it but says he's uncertain. Matheris checks the body but doesnt see anything of use.  He hands a potion to Jaxxen who heals some, and Matheris also heals Nathair.  The room has 5 columns in it in a kind of X pattern, four corners and one in the center.  There are bones on the floor, rubbish type debris and shit.  We find a passage in the back of the room that goes to stairs leading down.  Ulysses locks the magical riddle door back in the passage.  Matheris describes a plan where he wants to use Thunderwave. We also discuss throwing oil flask with bonfire, caltrops and more. Jaxxen says he can use Thaumaturgy.  

### Hobgoblins

Jaxxen leading again with Hereist. Jaxxen throws an oil flask down with a shortened lit candle attached to act like a molotov. It burns and then Jaxxen increases the flames with Thaumaturgy. There's a small fire. We then hear langauges being spoken. None of us understand it except Edwin, who says its goblin or hobgoblin.  They start coming up the stairs, and Edwin casts Create Bonfire on them.  Nathair gets as close to fire as he can, but then an arrow comes fired through from the other side and hits him.  Hereist goes to shield Nathair. Jaxxen readies his light crossbow. Edwin throws caltrops down the stairs. The fire dissipates, and the goblins come up.

Another is at disadvantage from blinding and swings at Hereist. The swing lands and Hereist is severely wounded now.

Matheris picks up daggers and caltrops. Ulysses goes down the stairs. Jinxia fires a short bow at the last hobgoblin but misses. The hobgoblin runs down the stairs and attacks Nathair. 

Jaxxen tries Chill Touch again, but fails. Edwin swings at the hobgoblin. It meets perfectly and kills the last hobgoblin standing.

#### Aftermath

When Matheris can get close enough to Hereist, he casts Healing Word, helping to restore Hereist's health who was nearly dead.

Edwin notices that there's a room down there.

The party wants to take a rest if possible to recover some, and secures the area.

Jaxxen sets up a string with bells in various places that can alert us.  Matheris also lays down the caltrops again.  Hereist also had some bells on string and set up as well.  

Nathair looks at the hobgoblins and notices the leader with better armor had a key around his neck. He grabs the key.

Someone goes back to the magical door and notices it has the same writing on the inside as the outside.

We take a short rest. Matheris plays a song of rest to aid us in recovery. and Jaxxen and Nathair are headled to the max. Nathair shows us the key he found.  Its metal, like iron and kind of ornate.

## Day 12

### Goblins and Hobgoblins

We hear the bells begin to ring. We're all up and ready. Edwin hears voices and says its goblins or hobgoblins, at least 2.  Nathair takes point.

#### Aftermath

Ulysses pretends to have a conversation with the slain goblin. And then mentions "Can't get any info from dead goblins".  Jaxxen invokes Misty Vision and creates an apparition of a goblin to taunt Ulysses, then dismisses it.  Matheris collects 2 bolts. We look over teh bodies.  Jaxxen starts a plan and invokes Mask of Many Faces to change appearance to be like a hobgoblin, and re-sets up Misty Visions to make a goblin. He grabs a longsword for good measure to appear hobgoblin like.  Nathair and Hereist look for stuff. Matheris and Jinxia find some silver and copper pieces, a long bow, 6 arrows some long swords and a metal shield. Hereist takes the metal shield. Nathair, Edwin and Hereist all get some copper.

We collect our bells and strings, step over the bodies and check the door. Ulysses dips his finger in Matheris ink and applies to his skin to darken. Jaxxen is disguised as a hobgoblin.  Matheris pulls out steel mirror and ink to dye his face and skin smoothly to attempt to appear as a drow. 

With Jaxxens goblin projection sends it ahead and hear goblin language being spoken. But Jaxxen's goblin doesn't make any noise.  Ulysses tries to grab Jinxia because he's scared but she brushes him off.  We hear a gong downstairs and lots of commotion. Matheris steps back to corn of room and sits down working on a ritual. He needs time to preapre.  Edwin hears goblins. Jaxxen makes his goblin shrug its shoulders as though in response to what real goblins are saying.  Jinxia is hiding.  Matheris continues his ritual.  Jaxxen makes his goblin point around. THen we hear shouting at the goblin vision. The gong stops and its silent.

Ulysses istalking to Hereist about facing a goblin army asking why he's into all this. Hereist's mission is all about adventure.

### Lots-o-Goblins

Jaxxen approaching looking like a hobgoblin sees a hobgoblin approaching with an arrow knocked in his bow ready to fire. Jaxxen decides to fire first, but misses. Hobgoblin returns fire and misses. Jaxxen casts Chill Touch and misses, the hobgoblin fires again and mises. Again Jaxxen fails to Chill Touch, and then the hobgoblin lands a hit.  Hereist fires a shot and misses, Nathair does nothing. Edwin lands a Bonefire cantrip again. Jaxxens Chill Touch fails again.  The hobgoblin then moves behind a wall out of sight.

Jaxxen says the hobgoblin didnt seem to recognize me, but viewed the goblin wasn't real.  Matheris is close to having his ritual finished but needs time.  Ulysses and Jaxxen discuss fermented bodies and Matheris bard debts.  

Matheris finishes his ritual, and casts Comprehrend Languages. --- WHAT! Edwin can translate goblin! but Matheris explains that he's got a better shot of convincing that he's a dark elf as he can now understand goblin and speak in undercommon.

We have a plan. Jinxia opens the magic riddle door and waits near it.  Jaxxen will make a distraction to use Misty Vision to make apparition of a human fighter.  Listening outside the door, Jinxia doesnt hear anything different from before.  We hear a loud voice asking who we are. Matheris speaks in undercommon about some work and cleanup. They answer back asing "Who are you?"  Matheris claims to be Drixt, an alchemist mapping these tunnels and thought the sector had been cleared. Goblin asks "Where is Zeldar?" Matheris doesn't know. Goblins ask him to come down plase. Matheris relays to us what all was discussed. Edwin thinks different and speaks in goblin. Says "My name is Kamric. I work for Zeldar. I order you to lay down your arms." Matheris asks and learns how to say "Surrender or Die" in goblin. Then he says it down the stairs. Goblins talking. Edwin says hes unsure what to do. Some of us prepare flasks of oil and a Bonfire cantrip.  Hearing goblin speak saying "Move forward! Kill them. Kill!"

Everybody gets back to hide. The goblins see the projection Jaxxen has made of human. He makes it appear to be running to the magical riddle door. Oil flasks and bonfires away and some take damage while running right through it as they are chasing what they think is a human.  There must be a dozen goblins rushing past!  There are going after the human trying to chase him down.  All but one rush through the door. Its in the way of closing the door. Jinxia pushing. Jaxxen casts Thauamturgy to slam the door shut.  The lingering goblin is on this side of the door and a battle commences between it and Jinxia. They damage each other. Jaxxen attempts Chill Touch again and fails yet again. Jinxia kills the goblin.

We hear goblins on the other side knocking on the door. Then we hear magic gears and levers. They must have triggered something. We hear metal moving and gears. Then a woosh-woosh, and silence.  Were they sliced and diced?

#### Aftermath

Matheris does the knock on the door to open it. It cracks open. He looks to see .... Nothing?

There seemed to be nothing.  No bodies. They are gone. Then he notices at the floor where it meets the wall, there is a goblin toe. The floor had opened up and dropped them.  Ulysses wants the toe and puts it around his neck on a makeshift necklace. We go back and search remaining bodies. Matheris finds quite a bit of gold, silver, and other coin. Gives that to Hereist so he can buy potions later on.  Nathair and Hereist grab some of the long swords to sell. 

We hear noise in a room downstairs. Then hear a door slam shut down the stairs and silence.  Matheris will stealthily go down the stairs and scope it out. Jaxxen mentions the boots of elvinkind and his stealthy ability. Matheris and Jaxxen swap footwear and Jaxxen does the scouting appearing as a hobgoblin, holding a longsword for good measure.  He sees nobody. Jaxen checks each of 4 doors to the left. They have bunks and dressers but no creatures present. There are lots of barrels and crates down here. He checks the furthest room on the left whose door is only halfway open. Looking in the last room has less bunks and its nicer than the others. Assumes this may be the leaders room. Its neatly kept. He finds a desk and chair. There's more long swords here and a longbow missing some strings. Finds an inkwell and some sheets of paper on the desk. The drawer has a keyhole.  Jaxxen doesnt want to try opening it just yet for fear of traps and doesnt want to open the other two doors yet. Goes back to group and informs of finding.

Hereist lights torches. They stay up the steps. Matheris and Jinxia come down with Jaxxen to check on the keyhole. We get the key from Nathair to see if it works. Jinixia checks for traps and doesnt think its trapped. Matheris tries the key but its too big. Jinxia picks the lock. Inside is a golden statute. Matheris recognizes it as related to the Chaotic Neutral church we saw on the surface. There's some coin here as well and we split it up. Next we go to check the key on teh doors. It doesnt work on any of them. Looking at the barrels there are 2 with liquid, one water, one ale.  We go back up the stairs back to the entrance and see if the key works in the super hard to pick door as well. Nope!  The group heads back downstairs to the room with the gong, barrels and crates.  Check the door straight ahead, its locked and has no keyhole.  But there is a symbol on the door written in undercommon.  The door on the wall opposite the 4 bunk rooms has a keyhole and is locked. Matheris looks at the gong on the side and wants it. Buts its kind of heavy so we leave it for now considering coming back here later. 

Matheris insert the key in the keyhole of the door and it goes in. Jinxia checks for traps and doesn't tink there is any. Matheris turns the key. Its trapped! He feels a needle go into his hand and is poisoned down to 1 health! He's then unconscious. The door is unlocked though. Goes in a few feet and up a staircase.  Jaxxen begins checking the rooms seeing if there is any antitode vials. Jinxia also looking around and finds a chest hidden under a bed in one of the rooms.  She checks for traps and finds one. Just stabs her short sword into it to activate it quickly. Similar needle juts out quickly and she captures some of the liquid into a vial. Its yellow.  She picks the lock. Inside a velvet siding. There are two vials, one yellow, one blue. She quickly takes the blue vial and puts it on Matheris lips. He t akes it in and it heals him. She then pockets the yellow vial. Also in the box she found a nice golden necklace with rubies and some more coin.

Matheris, now healed, looks around. Thinks the chest seems deeper than trays on top. Finds a false bottom in the check and within it are 2 potions. One recognized as a healing potion. The other has a picture of an arm and muscle. Matheris assumes thats a strength potion and saves for later.

We see nothing else in the room and decide to ascend the stairs beyond the freshly opened door. As we start going up we notice some light. Seems like natural light. As we come up there is a solid stone room about 9 feet by 9 feet and 8 feet tall. There's a door on one side. Sunlight on the other side. Metal door with a lock on it. The walls are like marble.  Jinxia checks the door for traps. Doesn't find any, and Matheris checks for traps. He also notices none.  Hereist unlocks the lock controlled by a deadbolt on the inside and slowly opens the door. Sees sunlight, and the grounds. He then exclaims "It's a fuckin graveyard!"

We appear to be in a mausoleum. There are other people on the streets nearby. Nobody in teh graveyard. Matheris clears the ink off his skin. Jaxxen changes to appear to be a human. There is a keyhole on the outside of the door and the key works in it. Jinxia checks for traps and doesnt see any. The key fits properly.

We don't recognize where we are but see a commoner approach with flowers. Matheris wishes her a good day. Jaxxen looks for any wording over the mausoleum and notices the name .. "ZELDAR". As we exit the cemetary, we find a plaque noting the name of the place as the "Fizer Cemetary".  There are no street signs indicating where we are.  The druid points north and thinks we may be down Dagger Blvd a ways. 

We head back towards the Drunken Goblin but cut across through alleys and side streets towards the stables. We stop at a clothing store for some fresh garbs. Edwin buys a dark hooded cloak. Matheris gets some costumes for bardic disguise. Jaxxen buys a fancy puffy pirate shirt and trousers and a dress for his "wife back home". Ulysses gets some new clothes as does everyone else. We then heads to the stabls, drop off Nathair and Ulysses and Matheris swaps some things in his chest. We goto Malachi Weapons to sell excess goods, and Matheris buys 100 bolts at the archery.

## Level Up

Everyone levels up.

Matheris, Jinxia and Jaxxen are now level 3.

Ulysses, Edwin, Northair, Hereist are now level 2.

Jaxxen feels a warmth from his ring go through his body. Feels the symbol on his arm warm as well. Then it returns to normal. Feeling this, Jaxxen looks at the ring and its glowing bright gold for a few minutes before returning to normal appearnce. He now feels attuned to the Ring of Protection.
