## Day 6

Matheris, Jinxia, and Jaxxen are continuing on the road headed to the largest city in the realm known as Nostr. 

Ume and Ulysses are on this lesser traveled road with a large forest on both sides. They had previously met and had setup camp nd are breaking down.  On approach, Jaxxen and his group assess that these two individuals are not a threat. 

We introduce ourselves and have discussion as we continue on the road together. We ask if Ume and Ulysses have seen any orcs.  They haven't.  Ulysses doesn't remember his past and is devoted to martial arts and defending himself. Looks to try to help the downtrodden and those whom are bullied and attacked as he was. Ulysses was taken in by an order of monks who let him choose his own name. We're about 3 days from the city.

Eventually we get to evening and decide to find a place to make camp. On a hill on the right side of the road a clearing is identified that may be good. We setup and the monk stretches. Matheris plays a flute. Jaxxen looks to the clear skies.  On either side of the road, large trees are very wide. Jaxxen and Ulysses gather some dead wood and talk for a bit of history. Ume helps ensure the wood they collect is dead, and not live. Jinxia opts to blend into a nearby small boulder to sleep. The group settles in for the night with fire crackling and hear sounds in the woods.  Matheris takes the first watch, then Jaxxen, and Ume. Ulysses is sleeping already and will go last. Matheris watch is without incident, as is Jaxxen's. On Umes watch, its about 2-3 am. Jaxxen goes into deep sleep and dreams of a bright green light anbd black serpent. Its shocking, rocking him to his core in and after some time, Jaxxen is awoken sitting up in a jolt, sweating intensely and grips his forearm. Jaxxen looks at his wrist, and for just a second thought he saw the serpent ove.  Jaxxen describes some of his background to Ume and goes back to sleep. Later, at 3 am, something wakes the whole group.. the sound of a man screaming, the worst kind of pain, blood curdling screem, deep in the woods. We all wake from it. Ulysses utters a phrase in halfling "a shadow is a trusted friend".  Matheris, Jinxia and Ulyssees will go to check out the scream.  Jaxxen and Ume stay with Dusty and Serafina at the camp. Before setting out, Jaxxen returns the boots of elvenkind to Matheris.

_Subgroup: Matheris, Ulysses and Jinxia_

Matheris, Ulysses and Jinxia head into the woods with a lantern for light. The woods get thicker. Can hear the dying sound of a man again. Matheris notices nothing special. They close half the distance. They try to actively hide and put the lantern out. Crickets starting up again with light out. Ulysses and Jinxia dont have good vision and Ulysses is holding onto Matheris' cloak They hear something on the ground, kind of heavy pounding, something of weight like bags of sand. Matheris sheaths his sword and readies his sling. Ulysses with quarterstaff in hand, they see a light on the ground up ahead. Jinxia gets some white sticky substance on her hand. They notice its on all the trees, sticky and whispy. Matheris thinks it could be some kind of spider. Ulysses suggests they ask the druid back at camp. The sound may have been someone falling prey to it.  The group hears a moan in the direction of the light and see humanoid sized humps on the ground with white sticky covering on all the trees. The light source is a torch on the ground. That area of the humps is kind of a clearing. The group proceeds to try to get closer for visibility. They hear stuff moving around in 2 different directions. Humanoids are encased in the sticky substance. Camp fire smoked out, and a tent thrown into one of the bushes. Matheris looks into the trees but doesn't see anything.  Ulysses listening and hears something from above. Can't pinpoint it and Jinxia also doesnt see. The party communicates intentions to return. And then an arachnid comes down making chittery ihsect noise, and attacks Matheris and Ulysses, landing on both of them. Multiple hairy legs trying to grab and bite. Missis with the bites but has held down. Senses that there is more than one.

_Party members regrouped_

Jinxia attempts to cut away webbing on Matheris. Ulysses shouts "Is anybody there?! Can you hear me?!" and hears a faint moan. He then looks and finds around a tree someone with chainmail armor laying against the tree and has some webbing on him with a wooden shield to the side.  He's hunched over in bad shape and barely alive. Think he was stung. He looks in trees. The moon flickers just right and he sees the two other spiders, about 40 feet away in the trees. Sees 3 more spiders, 5 total and lots of webs.  He shouts "There's 5 more spiders up in the trees!"

Jinxia wants someone to help Matheris. Jaxxen goes in, grabs Matheris and says "IF we're getting out of here, lets go" and begins moving back the way he came. The man in the chain mail makes out some words "Help... help.."  Ume rushes to him, picks him up and retreats. Ulysses and Jinxia follows promptly behind. Jaxxen is leading, with Ume in the back. We hear some noises behind us. 

Ume makes a bonfire cantrip **behind** the group in the forest. Jaxxen continues heading toward camp but is encumbered and moving slower. We get to camp, and the fire behind us went out.  The man and Matheris are propped up at the camp. Ume has an herbalism kit but doesnt have necessary components.  Ulysses takes a water pouch, pouring some in Matheris mouth. Jaxxen asks if any flowers or anything in the area could potentially help. Ume says theres a bark of a kind of tree in this area that can help. He describes the kind of tree to look for.  Ume, Ulysses and Jaxxen go to look for the tree. We relight Matheris lantern to see. Dont find anything yet. 

Jinxia remains with Matheris and the man. She searches the mans possessions looking for any coin. Finds 5gp, 2 empty scabbards, a pack on his back has rope and a torch. She also finds a small pick, and a little glass vial that has no labeling and is a shade of orange.

Ulysses and Jaxxen continue looking for the tree bark and Ulysses thinks he's found it. Ume goes over and collects some bark on a dagger that Jaxxen provides. He can use it as an antidoe. We head back to the camp to try to heal Matheris and the man. Pours some inside Matheris mouth and the other guy as well. There's no effect yet on either.

The party attempts a long rest and Jaxxen stays awake. Jinxia hears something approach and thinks its spiders. Up in the canopy, on the ground, there are 50 to 60 spiders approaching. Jaxxen wnats to get on the horse and head out. He takes the man and puts him on the horse. Ume gets Matheris on the mule. We head out as fast as we can. Get to the road at an angle. Behind us we see dozens of spiders at the edge of the forest bobbing up and down looking to us. We make note of the spider area on a rough drawn map, noting Arachnid Forest.  

We continue onwards and after some time, Matheris and the old man come to.  Ulysses asks him who he is. He replies "Herist".  Matheris is conscious but weak. Not too cognizant yet.  Evening time comes and we look for a place to rest. Find a clearing on the hill on opposite side of the road.  The order of watch is Jaxxen, Ume, and Jinxia. Jinxia asks if we know what the vial of liquid is or the stainless steal cylinder from the ruins.  Jaxxen says he's never seen a potion like that cylinder.  We setup camp. Moon getting full. People are healing. We get through the night.

## Day 7

When we wake in the morning we eat rations and discuss plans. We see a covered wagon coming down the road with a man on the front and a horse leading it and lanterns on both sides.  Jinxia wants to check it out. Ume asks if we should offer security or hitch a ride? Jaxxen asks if we should steal the wagon?  .. Matheris approaches the wagon and tries negotiating for a healing potion. Introduces himself and the rider is an old man named Otto. Otto claims to have business in the city of Nostr and doesnt have room in the wagon for people, nor has he any potions. Jinxia stealthily checks out whats in the wagon. She gets to the back and can slip inside, sees 4 chests with big locks on them. She may be noticed attempting to get inside. Matheris continues bantering to distract Otto and asks if he could share his travels. Ulysses himself had written a poem and asks Otto if he'd like to hear it.

```
   We heard a noice and became the hiders
   Not for long though there were spiders
   I stuck my head in the spiders dead
   Seen 50 more thouh and so we fled
```

Otto givs Ulysses a nod of his head. But then notices Jinxia and asks her to get out of his things.  Jinxia threatens Otto and says "Maybe you should get out of here".

Jaxxen and Ume are up on the hill at camp looking down. Ume notices a group of 6 humanoids in columns side by side with big pikes in the air and points it out.  They are up ahead and approaching the covered wagon from the direction of the city. Jaxxen suggest swe go down to the rest of the group. The man on the mule, and Jaxxen on horse. Old man on wagon notices 6 soldiers coming and says we may have trouble coming.  Matheris asks if they are hostile. Old man closes eyes, puts hand to side, opens eyes and says "These are unfriendlies. This will not be good. Not the usual soldiers you might think". Ume suggests attaching the horse to teh carriage to increase speed to go faster. Otto says it wont with additional weight.  Hereist the fighter gets off the mule.  Jaxxen suggests moving aside to allow the soldiers past without trouble. Otto says they will attack, and hes not going around. Jaxxen asks what kind of business he does and Otto says he's a simple salesman.

We hear commotion, as the soldiers have spotted us. They break formation and are running towards us with pikes in downward positions. We hear snarls and growls. Jinxia gon. Jaxxen fires his crossbow bolt and misses. Ume attempts to wrestle control of the the wagon from the old man.  Ulysses, Matheris and Jinxia prepare to get in the wagon. Jaxxen steadies on the side of the wagon and fires at the soldiers. A crossbow bolt bounces off platemail of one of the soldiers. Hereist asks for a weapon and Matheris hands a longsword to him. Ulysses hiding in the wagon along with Jinxia. Jaxxen stays on his horse. Ulysses is tethering Serafina to the back of the wagon.  Ume cracks the regns to get horse moving as fast as possible, then drops hs reigns to cast an entangle spell. The soldiers are coaught up in the vines and are using their short swords to try to free themselves.  We see creatures about 6 to 7 feet tall, well built, grotesque, with big cannines in their mouth, nasty looking and strong platemail armor.  Jaxxen coordinates with Ume for a plan and throws an oil flask in the entaglement while passing. The flask breaks spreading oil. Ume casts a bonfire cantrip and the oil intensifies its flames around the beasts.  Ulysses throws a dart but misses. We pass and the spell is broken. They've turned and are coming towards us. Some are trying to put the fire out on them. They are really angry now and running to us.  Jaxxen fires a crossbow bolt but misses. He then says "Throw stuff at them! Anyhthing!"  Jinxia throws the rest of the ball bearings out on the ground behind us causing two of them to fall on the bearings.  Otto begins casting a spell. Three powerful bolts shoot from his fingertips with golden power. One hits the ground but two of the beasts are squarely hit knocking them down. The two remaining beasts slow up to render aid to their fallen and we successfully get away.

An hour or so later, the horses are getting tired and we are slowed down. We ask Otto if he's familiar with the area and he warns about spiders. Jaxxen suggests he may be able to identify some things. Otto says that up at the crossroads there is an inn and buildings before the main busy road into the city.  This area of the road is much better. We'll get there a little after dark. Jinxia asks Otto if he knows anything about the vials of liquid. With his long skinny white fingers he asks "may i see those?" and Jinxia hands them over. He takes the vials, one with red liquid, one with the stainless steel. The flask he says "oh it must be something good, but I dont know. This one in the red is a potion of strength".  Matheris asks how he knew and Otto says he's seen it before says the red with silver lining and is certain its a potion of strength.  Otto wans to hear a song tonight at the inn and Matheris says he may be able to.  Otto then declares that he needs to take a big shit when he gets to the inn.

**The Inn**

It's after dark and the old man insists we go further as the inn is not too far. We see lights of a few buildings and more traffic. We arrive to the inn which is named the Happy Fairy. We see horses tied on the outside and a half-elf standing by a horse. There are some stables around the side. 

_Ulysses heads into the inn to sleep and logs off._

Otto goes to the stable, pays a gold piece to stable his horse.  Jaxxen does the same, paying 1gp/night to stable his horse and get him well fed.  There's no noticeable guards but plenty of people around.  Jinxia pays attention to the money exchange at the stables, looks where they put the coin.  Main caretaker puts in upper pocket and has a short sword on his side. We hear the sound of people at the inn.

Jaxxen quickly scopes out the exterior of the building for stairs, windows, sees curtains drawn and finds 2 doors off the back. One he hears nothing and the other the sounds of a kitchen.  Relays findings to the group. Matheris gathes his flasks to refill inside. Ume goes to the man that was rescued and pats him on the back to get him into the inn. Matheris retrieves his sword from him. The old man thanks Ume for helping him. Says his friends are all deceased and thanks us for coming to his aid. Matheris says for him to spend a night in the tavern and offers drinks to the old man. We open doors of the inn, smell spicey potatoes, meat, delicious smells. It really hits us, then we see someone in the corner playing a stringed instrument. Not singing much, just playing. Two waitresses service food and drinks, dressed for serving, and a large man with white apron on doing cooking. Matheris heads straight for the bar.  Theres a handful of people there and he sets up at bar on a stool.  Jinxia takes a quiet corner to observe. 

Jaxxen wants a room, talks to waitress who refers him to someone in the inn named Myrtle.  Upon finding her he pays 1gp for a room for hte night and heads to room #5. His plan is to try to scale the exterior and listen in on any conversation in the rooms.  

Ume wants to join Matheris and other man at the bar but theres no room and he sits at a table with others instead.  A story of the encounters is relayed to people at the table. Ume asks if they've seen creatures in plate armor. The others at the table haven't. They are headed to Nostr themselves but didn't see any creatures.

Matheris hails the bartender or a waitress when available. An elf comes over cleaning a glass. Asks how he can help. Matheris has some questions and asks whats it cost for a drink and food. The elf indicates the price and mentions the spicey potatoes, soup and chicken, beef, all kinds of food. Matheris orders a plate of chicken and spicey potatoes, slides 2gp over and points towards the fighter and says .. until it runs out, keep their tankards full and i'll take one for the road. Asks if he knows anyone specializing in curing poison.  The half-elf motions towards a a gentleman in the back corner and says his name is Timar.  Matheris approaches Timar who wears a black hooded robe and has a mustache.  Asks him about poisons and healing. The man says that this place could use some better entertainment. They negotiate a bit and Matheris hands him his potion of strength for a cure and promises to entertain if cured. Also points to the man in chainmail. The deal is struck and the man tests the potion putting a bone at the top of the liquid in the vial verifying it.  Matheris hands a vial to the fighter and consumers the other. Both are freed of the poison and restored to 100% health. 

Jaxxen's room has a single bed, made for a traveler with a table and chair. There is a window in the room. He locks the door, checks the room, and then leaves most of his items taking only what he needs for the outside. He opens the window and starts scaling around using his pitons and climbing kit.  The first window he gets to he can open it, but doesnt understand the conversation, as its foreign to him. The next is openable and lit and the third window wont open. Jaxxen returns to the second window to take a closer look and sees a half-elf female at a small table brushing her hair. There's a mirror reflecting back andhe also notices a rapier next to the table. Jaxxen traverses back reversing steps to his room and goes down to the bar to grab a drink and relay findings to the group, particularly Jinxia if they can hatch a plan.

Ume the druid grabs a drink and prefers to hang outside. Its evening and a number of people are walking about doing things, tending to horses, pack etc, checking down the road.  Something catches his eye. He notices a chair on the edge side of the inn, next to the road.  Ume thinks about the old man, the powerful wizard and doesnt know where he went.  Ume goes to the stables, talks to stablehand. Found out instigators of the past have found a deathly demise. Ume notes there's no guards and asks how its defended. The stablehand says there is some protection but wont relay how. Ume relays info to the others before heading to another table to try to gather info on what happened before.  Herist the man in the chainmail tells his story and what he could remember of the spiders. They share their travels, some had run-ins with goblins about a week ago. Come through small hill from another town and were attacked by 7 goblins, killed most, but one ran off.  Ume notes the stables and rooms are so expensive but there's no guards in sight. Person says we saw how they protect this place. The second story building above teh stables has people with heavy crossbows standing watch. Says the guy in the corner that got the healing from are swindlers and thieves. Puts up glass of ale and they toast.

Matheris makes his way to individual playing stringed instrument. That person is half-lef looks up and introduces himself. They agree to have Matheris take over for a bit to sing of his tales while the other takes his lute and goes to get a drink. Matheris plays an uplifting song before laying down his hat, making use of prestidigation for showers of sparks enticing people to give him coins. As it gets more entertaining, the closed conversations in the room get more lively. Some tapping their toes and some watching Matheris.

Jinxia notices a really big guy and axe with studded armor and shield leaning against a table. Hes eating a lot of food and may have a big coin purse on his right belt.  The guy focused mainly on his meal, drinking a lot of ale in big gulps.

Jaxxen and Jinxia discuss the half-elf upstairs and rapier considering options to potentially acquire it, but then think about the risks and may try to do some pickpocketing outside instead.  The big burly guy with his ale belches, somewhat causing a scene with his inebriations. Jaxxen mentions to Jinxia that if we wait here long enough, that guy could be an easy mark. Jinxia is worried that the big man could hurt them.  They notice the group in the corner also playing close attention to the big guy.  A plan is decided to try to trip one of the guys when they approach the man as a distraction so Jinxia can attempt to steal teh purse under the table.  They sit down at a closer table with a dwarf nearby.  Jaxxen tells their story of the tower of umar and draws out a copy of the map from memory based on that one previously made and makes note of some interesting stonework the dwarf may want to check out.  Sells the map for 5sp and notes info about the trap at the entrance, carrion crawler and basilisk.  Jinxia then notices a robed figure talking to the big man sitting down, trying to ask a question. The man is inebreiated. Another hooded figure behind him bending over to touch his boot. Jinxia elbows Jaxxen to indicate whats going on. Jaxxed bumps the hooded figure bending over into the big guy.  While this is going on, Jinxia sucecssfully gets under the table, cuts the purse and quickly gets out. She then grabs onto Jaxxen and pleads not to start a fight with this guy. Jaxxen agrees and returns to the table with the dwarf.  The Dwarf being curious of what happened. Jaxxen says he was just interested in the boots the guy is wearing, says they looks like boots of elvenkind and he just wanted a closer look.  The dwarf in his inebreiated state, briefly mentions a mine, but then wont talk any more about it.  Jinxia sneaks up to Matheris, slips the coins in, and then goes to a room for the night. Pays and gets room #2.  Jaxxen takes leave and heads to his room #5.

Matheris purchases a room for himself. He earned a gold piece from the inn owner, 19 silver, 27 copper and spends a gold on a room getting room #1. Jinxina heads to his room, retrieves the coin purse, and splits the take with Jaxxen (26gp,2pp,1sp each). 

Jaxxen looks out towards the stables to see if he can verify the existance of watchment with crossbows. Doesnt seem them, but does see a catwalk overhead which would be a good place for someone to attack.  Asleep, Jaxxen is woken by a knock at the door. He prepares his dagger and goes next to the door but doesnt answer. He hears some instruments working the lock.  He promptly opens the door, and kicks at the person pushing him back. Then hits another assailant with his dagger, and green-flames the second on the ground with fire damage.  The first person is up and hits Jaxxen with his own dagger. The battle proceeds and quickly Jaxxen kills them.  He checks the hallway, sees the lights are out, and closes the door with the bodies inside.  He quickly checks over the bodies finding coin, a scroll, thieves tools and kit and one wearing a fancy necklace.  He leaves the lesser coin, and takes 13 of the 14gp and 5 daggers.  A woman is heard asking why the lights are out.  Jaxxen then yells from within his room "Thief! Thief! -- DIE!". The lady calls for some guards and 2 heavily armed big guys come down with crossbows. Jaxxen says these thieves broke into his room while he was asleep and he killed them in self defense. The guards check over the bodies, note the condition and asks how they attacked. Jaxxen hands over 3 of the daggers they had and claims that he took the weapons from them after the fight.  The guards take the bodies away and another comes along introducing Corum.  Jaxxen insists that he shouldnt have to pay for the room if its not well protected and was harmed. The man gives him a potion which Jaxxen drinks and heals some. The guy ends up paying him 2gp to Jaxxen for his troubles.  Jaxxen thanks hiim and goes back to sleep.

__Jaxxen, Jinxia, and Matheris level up__
