## Day 8

Jaxxen wakes in the morning, leaves some things in his room and heads down for food.  He sees the clientele has switched out, but still quite bustling with activity.  There are several tables open and after Jaxxen chooses one to sit at, he orders some eggs and grits.  Asks about Ostrich eggs, but they dont have any of those. They do have large eggs though.  The waitress comes over to take a drink order and Jaxxen has his waterskin refilled. He tips the waitress 3 silver and still somewhat alarmed from last night, asks if anyone here seems out of the ordinary.  The waitress indicates that all seems normal, nothing out of the ordinary.

He sees Matheris wonder down the stairs, his hair all a mess. Jinxia with him, ready to go.  A waitress helps Matheris to his breakfast needs and he asks for half a chicken, an ale, and a coffee. Jinxia wants whatever he doesnt eat of the chicken.  Foods on the house. Matheris flips her a silver piece.

Jaxxen describes the incident last night, and shows the paper that fell out of a scroll to Jinxia and Matheris. Jinxia thinks the G means guild. But doesnt recognize the names of them.  Knows it was written by and for a thief to read. Look at the scroll. It's magical, has some runes on it. I know its magic.  Matheris could examine the scroll to identify it but doesnt have the material components.

Jaxxen explains what happened with the dwarf and selling a copy of the map made of the ruins of Umar Tower.

Ume comes down and says hes gotta go. Has to check on something in the woods and mentions that Ulysses had something he had to check out and would meet at Nostr.  

Matheris goes to the baths and gets clean.

Jaxxen telephatically communicates to Jinxia suggesting to make a copy of room keys for when we return. Jinxia will try to sketch the keys for rooms 2, and 5. 

Matheris comes out from bathing.

Jaxxen returns to his room, gathers supplies, but makes an indention of his room key in the sealing wax.

Regroups and checks out. Returns keys to the waitress.

we walk out. 3 wagons (2 with grain, 1 with potatoes) loaded headed to nostr. 2 empties coming out.  we didnt' notice Otto's wagon.

We head to the stables. a few people in the courtyard. up above we do see guys with heavy crossbows. down below one of the stablehands comes out, asking if ready for mounts.

Matheris enquires about the elder man with the wagon, turns out he left a few hours ago.  Serafina ok as well as chest.

We see another guy with heavy crossbow and short sword talking to manager.

Jaxxen enquires about his horse, and feed for the road.  For food for the road, its 4 silver for a day. Jaxxen gives him 5 and accepts the feed and puts in his pack.

We head to the general store.  We see Hereist coming in our direction. His head down and sad. Matheris greets him. Slept outside, it was fine. He joins us on and Jaxxen provides him 2 daggers.  At the store we see some folks outside with horses. We go in and its heavily stocked. About 5-6 workers constantly working restocking. Looks like some local security as well, with heavy crossbows and shortswords, strategically positioned.

Matheris asks Hereist if he specializes in any weapons. He prefers a long or short sword. Hes best with a long sword and shield to cause attacking creature to have disadvantage when friendly is near him.  Matheris enquires about identifying magic items, but the shopkeep isn't able.

Asks about swords and shield. Shopkeep pulls out a longsword. Hereist looks it over and says its a fine sword.  And pulls a wooden shield as well.  Through negotiation, we get the price on a wooden shield and short sword down to 31gp, with Jaxxen paying 14gp and Jinxia and Matheris the rest.  Matheris swaps his long sword for the short sword that they acquired for Herist who now has a long sword, shield and 2 daggers.

Matheris asks the shopkeep about the thieves guilds in Nostr. He doesnt have specific knowledge just knows theres multiple guilds. Indicates there's a tax to get into Nostr.  If have a cargo of food they don't charge you. But otherwise, individuals pay 6 sp to get into Nostr.

Jaxxen says it sounds like the thieves guild starts at the entrance to the city!

Shopkeep says the City is booming, so much trade, with ships coming and going. When the king imposed the entry tax, there were people upset about it.

Matheris asks if he may know a way in or out of the city avoiding toll roads.  Shopkeep hesitant, but describes a spot 1000 yards south of the gate where there's spaces in between the walls that could be used. Green bush growing out of side of wall. could slip in. If caught by guards could be jailed.

while heading back to stables, Jaxxen describes to Jinxia his ability to disguise self and change appearance, that they could use to appear as one of the guards and allow Jinxia to shop.  The group doesnt take any immediate action on it, but considers for the future.

A half-elf turns down an offer someone is trying to sell a horse for 90gp. Half-elf offers 60gp. Jaxxen offers 64gp. Half-elf trying for a deal. The other now says he wants 75gp. Wants a room and a bath and something to eat.  Half-elf doesnt have anything super fancy and is turning to head into the inn. The guy selling the horse accepts 66 gold for the horse. He puts under his clothes and he goes quickly into the inn. Ive always called him Thunder, but you can call him whatever you want. Jaxxen hands the horse over to Hereist.  Matheris asks that Hereist join him in the ballad of the generosity of Sir Jaxxen when they reach the Drunken Goblin Tavern.  

Matheris gets Serafina. Jaxxen gets Dusty. Jinxia crawls into the chest on Serafina, and we head out.

We pass a number of people heading the other way. Peaceful journey. We're impressed by how large Nostr appears as we get closer. Blonde elf, fair skinned headed to Nostr, has a religious symbol around her neck, praying. She looks to sky, and with left hand praying hard. Another person traveling with her.

We see a large battlement facility up ahead. Walls of Nostr arent completely solid. Its walls on outside with exceptions here and there. We see houses outside city and blacksmiths working outside the city and farmers fields. 

Jaxxen suggests he could make the appearance of a cart using silent image, it'd only be visual, and would be discovered with physical inspection.  Jinxia volunteers to check how the process is during wagons entering to see how closely its scrutinized. By the time she gets up there, sees 15 guards at the gates, stopping wagons, doing a little search on each. Those without commercial goods there's coin exchange.  Jinxia reveals the dilema.  Most wagons were single people with cargo. One or two wagons had cargos with multiple people. Each had to pay a coin.  The fortress had over 60 guards at that area practicing different military activities.

We see a man outside who has bundles of wheat near him and strike a deal to buy some bundles of wheat from him to load on our horses. And he verifies the bush and a large bush tree, behind it is an opening about 8 feet wide. Lot of people use that to get in.  Matheris asks his name. It's Norton.  There's patrols in the city. Two houses and an alley beyond the bush. After that it gets to street. Probably no guards there, most of the time.

We find the bush and the opening is wider than others. More ideal for passage that we need.  Jaxxen checks the area for magic. Bush had brown nuts that glowed a little. Jaxxen doesn't know anything about deez nuts.  We enter the alleyway between houses. It opens up and we see more houses.  Gets more congested. Opens to small streets. Look around for commerce, but its just people that live here washing clothes. Poor people.  Jaxxen suggests we could sell the wheat at cost. They offer 4 copper. Jaxxen says that seems fair. Matheris agrees to sell it cheaply. Kids and adults come running out for the cheap food.

Busy street with lots of people. Activity everywhere. Candlemaker at the candle shop. People talk about the market ahead and got a good deal on some fruit... Next street deeper into city. Wide street, open air market. Stands as far as your eye can see into the market. No idea how many there are in the city, but this is one.  We see some large vendors that have people help them with their wares. Seems like locals. Nothing spectacular, but has every common thing you can think of. Its about 2pm. Matheris hails them and asks if knows of a safe affordable inn or someone that can identify magic.  Shopkeep knows of tower of High Sorcery.  Purchased 4 oil flasks, and Jinxia bought 10.  Next stall has some footwear.. then clothes, and then on to archer.  Jaxxen buys 20 crossbow bolts.

We get to a locksmith and Matheris inquires about a lock for his storage box, and the shopkeep here shows him one for 15gp but it only has one key. Its a poisonous lock. Jinxia pops out and asks if he can make another lock and he refers the group to someone nearby that can make keys for 7sp.  She pays for the lock. The guy shows her how to set and unset the lock with the poison. She heads to the guy that can make keys and buys a key copy to this lock. And then also asks if able to replicate a key from a drawing. She pays 2gp to have 3 keys made from the drawings.

Regroup and we head to Owl street to find the stables passing other vendors. Owl street on the right, its quieter, not as busy as market street.
