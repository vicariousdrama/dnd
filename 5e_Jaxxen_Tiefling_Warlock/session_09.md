<i>The main group is in the 40x40 room where we took out some hobgoblins.</i>

Ulysses comes in through the cemetery, sneaking through teh gate. He busts into the 40x40 foot room and greets us. Explains he had been meditating and now has new abilities.  We finish our short rest and considered extending to a full rest for improved recovery.  Outside, it is dark above.

## Another Round of Hobgoblins

We concoct a plan. A time later, a goblin bangs on the door and says "Food? Do you want food?"  Edwin replies "Come back later, we're taking a shit!". Its now that Ulysses learns of the goblin toe necklace. Jaxxen heads to the pillar room and investigates for any secret walls. Ingrin guards the door with Ulysses and Jinxia also aids in checking for secret passages. None are found and so Jinxia opens the riddle door and hides behind it. Jaxxen hides behind a pillar. Matheris disguises himself as a hobgoblin. Hereist and Ingrin are outside teh lower door in big room hiding in bunk room.  Jaxxen takes the form of a hobgoblin and creates Misty Vision of the form of a human. He then messages Matheris that the group up top is all set.  

Matheris hits the war gong 3 times.  He messages Edwin asking how to say "Get em" in Goblin, and Edwin responds in kind.  After some time, the door opens and goblin starts walking into the room. Matheris acts injured as a hobgoblin and points up stairs. Other hobgoblins rush in. Jaxxen makes the humanoid shape appear to swing weapons in the air and Matheris feigns passing out. Goblins pulls out sword. Jaxxen guides the image of human to the hallway around corner and humanoid disappears as its out of view. Goblins are rushing after and Jinxia tries to close the door but struggling. Jaxxen tries Thaumaturgy but its not enough to close as a Goblin pushes back and hits Jinxia with a scimitar.

Jaxxen casts chill touch on the hobgoblin for 16 necrotic damage. Jinxia stabs the gobling and disengages to run toward Jaxxen. Edwin casts create bonfirre at the goblins and hobgoblins. The hobgoblin gets out unscated but the goblin fails. Hobgoblin runs for Jaxxen hitting for 7. Jaxxen evades and sends message to Matheris that the plan didn't go perfectly and runs down the stairs. Jinxia goes at the hobgoblin, misses and moves to disengate. Edwin attacks and does some small amount of damage. Hobgoblin catches Jinxia, swings but misses right above her head.  The battle continues for a bit. For a time, Edwin changed form to a dire wolf and began biting hobgoblins. We achieve success and gather some more armor for Hereist. Jinxia locates a keyring with 6 keys on it. Jaxxen consumes a healing potion and readies light crossbow

## Checking the Corridor

Matheris looks in the doorway and sees a number of doors on either side down a wide hallway about 12 feet wide. We hear a scream. Jaxxen and Matheris look like hobgoblins and walkd down to act like we are doing the rounds checking on prisoners. Up ahead see appearance of a goblin approaching. Look into screaming cell and see 2 humanoids chained to wall and a goblin whipping them.  Jaxxen uses Thaumaturgy to make a fart sound in the room. Edwin hears goblin say that a goblin farted. Matheris uses Prestidigation to make the goblins pants look like he shit himself. Another goblin punches the goblin in the face. On left side of hallway a door opens and goblin carrying tray says something in goblin. We walk down halway and see more prisoners in chains some beaten and bloody. We find a cell with a big burly guy with gnarly teeth and messed up face and scales about him. Matheris tries talking to it in Draconic and it speaks back saying he was attacked in the woods. Jaxxen sends message to Ingrin notifying her that there are cells of prisoners being tortured. Hobgoblin approaches heavily armed and Jaxxen makes a laughing sound behind it as it approaches to startle it. Matheris makes a sound "Get em" in goblin that he learned from Edwin in a message to the hobgoblin. The hobgoblin goes into a door on the right. 

The floor here is still stone with lot of stone and dirt on it and 16 foot high. We cant see end of hallway, but we discuss plan to free the Draconic, heal him to use for extra support. Ingrin hears something come down steps from pillar room and Hereist hides in corner. Matheris readies a spell. Two goblins come down. Ingrin attacks and Hereist as well and hits and kills. Jaxxen and Hereist rush steps to pillar room and Hereist runs to riddle door with Jaxxen following. Hereist shuts the door and the gears lock up. Jinxia lays down caltrops near magical riddle door and Hereist lays down 6 more before lighting his lantern. Jaxxen suggests rolling the barrels to use as partial cover as the hallway is wide open and readies his crossbow. Hereist gets his longsword out and Jinxia has the keys ready. Edwin readies bonfire. Matheris opens the outer door. Jaxxen in hobgoblin form scows and acts like escorting Edwin and Jinxia. We get to the third door and see nobody in cell. Matheris tries keys and finds on third try. Slowly opens door and shuts inside. Jaxxen escorts prisoner Ingrin to the room. Jinxia checks and finds key that opens shackles to the dragonborn and after getting unlocked Ingrin casts cure wounds on him.
