<i>The main group is in the 40x40 room where we took out some hobgoblins.</i>

Ulysses comes in through the cemetery, sneaking through teh gate. He busts into the 40x40 foot room and greets us. Explains he had been meditating and now has new abilities.  We finish our short rest and considered extending to a full rest for improved recovery.  Outside, it is dark above.

We concoct a plan. A time later, a goblin bangs on the door and says "Food? Do you want food?"  Edwin replies "Come back later, we're taking a shit!". Its now that Ulysses learns of the goblin toe necklace. Jaxxen heads to the pillar room and investigates for any secret walls. Ingrin guards the door with Ulysses and Jinxia also aids in checking for secret passages. None are found and so Jinxia opens the riddle door and hides behind it. Jaxxen hides behind a pillar. Matheris disguises himself as a hobgoblin. Hereist and Ingrin are outside teh lower door in big room hiding in bunk room.  Jaxxen takes the form of a hobgoblin and creates Misty Vision of the form of a human. He then messages Matheris that the group up top is all set.  

Matheris hits the war gong 3 times.  He messages Edwin asking how to say "Get em" in Goblin, and Edwin responds in kind.  After some time, the door opens and goblin starts walking into the room. Matheris acts injured as a hobgoblin and points up stairs. Other hobgoblins rush in. Jaxxen makes the humanoid shape appear to swing weapons in the air and Matheris feigns passing out. Goblins pulls out sword. Jaxxen guides the image of human to the hallway around corner and humanoid disappears as its out of view. Goblins are rushing after and Jinxia tries to close the door but struggling. Jaxxen tries Thaumaturgy but its not enough to close as a Goblin pushes back and hits Jinxia with a scimitar.

Jaxxen casts chill touch on the hobgoblin for 16 necrotic damage. Jinxia stabs the gobling and disengages to run toward Jaxxen. Edwin casts create bonfirre at the goblins and hobgoblins. The hobgoblin gets out unscated but the goblin fails. Hobgoblin runs for Jaxxen hitting for 7. Jaxxen evades and sends message to Matheris that the plan didn't go perfectly and runs down the stairs. Jinxia goes at the hobgoblin, misses and moves to disengate. Edwin attacks and does some small amount of damage. Hobgoblin catches Jinxia, swings but misses right above her head.  The battle continues for a bit. For a time, Edwin changed form to a dire wolf and began biting hobgoblins
