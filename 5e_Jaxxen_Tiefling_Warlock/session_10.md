_The main group is in the Library deciding where to rest_

We decided to take a long rest.  Matheris hands scrolls to Jaxxen (Eldritch Blast, Cause Fear, Hellish Rebuke, and Arms of Hadar). 

Leera is outside the library in main corridor and is near the next door. She does some thieves cant to inform Jinxia she needs her help. Jinxia goes to check the door to the storage room where Leera is, checking it for traps.  She hears someone calling out for help. She doesnt think there are traps but knows the door is locked. Wants someone there. 

Jaxxen is curious about the room on the map labeled as murky water. Jaxxen checks the door of the murky water room. Its not like the others. Its metal like a fortified door.

Edwin is still looking through the library for interesting books. Finds one with a map of his homeland that was taken over by a tyrant. Its quite detailed.

Back in the corridor, Jaxxen gives up on the door and heads over to Jinxia and Leera.

Matheris in the library working on making notes on map.

Jaxxen, Leera, and Jinxia looking at the door. Door is solid wooden with no windows. Jaxxen tries the handle. Its locked. Hear sounds from within calling out "Help... help" in undercommon and common. Kieran is a character inside and claims had a confrontation with another of their kind and they did a hold person spell. Heard a big battle several hours ago and been quiet since until hearing whispers. A hissing sound is heard.

Matheris asks "who are you you? why is this not a trap?"  Kieran responds that shes strapped to a wall, and  to please help. Makes more hissing.  Jaxxen suggests opening the door. There's only one voice inside and we can close it if need be. He equips his orb and dagger.  Hereist gets his longsword out and shield up. Edwin casts guidance on Jinxia and Jinxia works on picking the lock. She's successful. Matheris uses mage hand to open the door. Jaxxen whips it open with Thaumaturgy. We see a dark elf woman shackled to the wall. She has battle scars on her and one that looks like it is burning on her left shoulder. Matheris begins unlocking the shackles from the keyring. These are a different color and better made.  Jaxxen provides a potion to Kieran.

She tells us she was goingto volunteer as a gladiator and thats what brought her into the clutches of this drow. Due to her patron had to follow the orders of her guild members. Other dark elf sensed her following him and did horrible magic to her and would get even when back from a trip. Dark elf looked with sinister smile saying I'm not done with you yet when binding her.

Matheris investigates and notices a hole. Jaxxen asks Kieran what caused that burning scar. Kieran replies its from great power, not the one who controls her. Edwin asks if the one who captured had any marks, and she responds a tatoo, robe and white hair.. Matheris asks what the tattoo looked like. It is just undercommon symbols but dont know the meaning. Kieran specializes in exploration and is a retired gambler.  Matheris asks if been here recently and Kieran says its been several days.  For equipping we get her somehting that can fire projectiles. A bow.  Jaxxen hands her a dagger to use and cut dead bodies as necessary to get to weapons.

Leera is studying the hole and thinks it can be opened easily. Jinxia investigates it and learns the hole trap works a mechanism to open the door. Need a thin item to push in. Kieran
