_The group is in the library of the lair previously run by Zeldar_

A quick trip to the Drunken Goblin Tavern through the mirror, Jinxia finds Oli who she had met on a prior encounter with thieves cant.  He agrees to join our group, and we haul in yet one more rando to the "lair". He's quite trusting that Oli.

_Alliance with Garth_

Garth wants to form an alliance and has a map to the Underdark below murky water.  He detected a `crystal shard` in teh hallway carpet that was jammed into it. It can be used as a spell focus.  He also found books in the library about the paintings and the mirror.

Matheris demonstrates Magic Mouth as a way to create alarms around the lair.

Garth and Cobalt talk about the area below the water wier. They would really appreciate joining forces.

We discuss the portraits and the need to say `shut` and `open` in Undercommon to toggle them being locked or open.  Matheris and Garth know Undercommon and teach how to say these words to the rest of the party.  When the paintings are shut, they go dark and the mirror becomes a solid mirror.

The water below the water weir will dip about 100 feet down and then 100 feet back up.  This is quite the distance to swim as nobody has swimming speed and we'll be slowed. We need to hold our breath, but not all of us can make the distance without running out and suffocating. Garth indicates he has means to help some. There were the potions in the trunk. He also says he has credit with Malachi and we should prepare for a journey.

_Drunken Goblin and Oli_

The group gets ready to exit via the Drunken Goblin Tavern to head to Malachi's place.  Jaxxen changes appearance to that of a half elf. 

In the Drunken Goblin on the 3rd floor, Jinxia notices an elf she had met previously. There are bards playing blaring loud and well with shadows on the wall.  

Oli asks if we have any work. Jinxia nad Matheris talk to him about a potential perilous journey that we need to prepare for in a cave involving swimming.  Edwin leans in and asks Oli if he's seen any wanted posters with our faces on it. Oli indicates that he has seen some out for Matheris and Jinxia. When asked if Oli has any alignments with any guilds or groups, he indicates he's an independent.

Matheris listens to the bards play. Sees Delia and he nodes at her play. When she finishes, more louder bards get on stage.

We exit the Drunken Goblin out the VIP entrance to the secret shop with the velvet curtains which looks like an old art gallery.  Then take a left on Merchants and to Bard Home.

_Some Guards spot Us_

As we go around the Drunken Goblin Tavern, some guards are on the opposite side. Matheris casts silent image to appear as a human. Guards come looking and want us to show our faces. Edwin is initially not complying. Jinxia is hooded and begins drooling. An attempt to charm the guards fails and a battle ensues.
