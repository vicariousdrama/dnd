_The group is in the library of the lair previously run by Zeldar_

A quick trip to the Drunken Goblin Tavern through the mirror, Jinxia finds Oli who she had met on a prior encounter with thieves cant.  He agrees to join our group, and we haul in yet one more rando to the "lair". He's quite trusting that Oli.

## Alliance with Garth

Garth wants to form an alliance and has a map to the Underdark below murky water.  He detected a `crystal shard` in teh hallway carpet that was jammed into it. It can be used as a spell focus.  He also found books in the library about the paintings and the mirror.

Matheris demonstrates Magic Mouth as a way to create alarms around the lair.

Garth and Cobalt talk about the area below the water wier. They would really appreciate joining forces.

We discuss the portraits and the need to say `shut` and `open` in Undercommon to toggle them being locked or open.  Matheris and Garth know Undercommon and teach how to say these words to the rest of the party.  When the paintings are shut, they go dark and the mirror becomes a solid mirror.

The water below the water weir will dip about 100 feet down and then 100 feet back up.  This is quite the distance to swim as nobody has swimming speed and we'll be slowed. We need to hold our breath, but not all of us can make the distance without running out and suffocating. Garth indicates he has means to help some. There were the potions in the trunk. He also says he has credit with Malachi and we should prepare for a journey.

## Drunken Goblin and Oli

The group gets ready to exit via the Drunken Goblin Tavern to head to Malachi's place.  Jaxxen changes appearance to that of a half elf. 

In the Drunken Goblin on the 3rd floor, Jinxia notices an elf she had met previously. There are bards playing blaring loud and well with shadows on the wall.  

Oli asks if we have any work. Jinxia nad Matheris talk to him about a potential perilous journey that we need to prepare for in a cave involving swimming.  Edwin leans in and asks Oli if he's seen any wanted posters with our faces on it. Oli indicates that he has seen some out for Matheris and Jinxia. When asked if Oli has any alignments with any guilds or groups, he indicates he's an independent.

Matheris listens to the bards play. Sees Delia and he nodes at her play. When she finishes, more louder bards get on stage.

We exit the Drunken Goblin out the VIP entrance to the secret shop with the velvet curtains which looks like an old art gallery.  Then take a left on Merchants and to Bard Home.

## Some Guards spot Us

As we go around the Drunken Goblin Tavern, some guards are on the opposite side. Matheris casts silent image to appear as a human. Guards come looking and want us to show our faces. Edwin is initially not complying. Jinxia is hooded and begins drooling. An attempt to charm the guards is made by Edwin.

Guards are charmed and Edwin tells thm that the people they are looking for were in the Drunken Goblin Tavern.

Jaxxen casts invisibility on Jinxia.

Jinxia steps away from the group and attempts to cut the ties on a pouch of a passerby. She succeeds in getting the pouch.

Edwin gives a pouch of 2000gp to Matheris and changes shape into a cat.

Guards look at us and don't do anything.

We make it to Malachi's Weapons.

---

## Malachi's

Cobalt leads us in to talk to Nade. Says "Need to speak to Ruger". Nade asks if he has an appointment.  Cobalt walks past, says "No" and starts walking up the stairs.  We follow him and notice Malachi's Armory across the way.  Ruger is a strong looking human with red hair who welcomes Cobalt.

We quickly find that we're unable to get any general supplies like silk rope or watertight armor here.

Matheris gets a rapier for Jinxia (rapier+1). Jinxia made her presence known and is no longer invisible.

Jinxia gets a bag of holding as does Matheris.  On the shelf behind Ruger is a hand crossbow but nobody wants it.

Ruger pulls out special arrows. Hereist and the Ranger say its nice in addition to Jinxia wanting it. Each want 4 of the special arrows. These are +1.  Ruger also has some special crossbow bolts, 6 of them in fact at +1.  

For Edwin, Matheris gets a quarterstaff of better quality and Oli gets a +1 rapier.  Hereist gets a +1 Longsword and a +1 mace for Ingrin. We go to leave and Matheris puts Jinxia in the bag of holding.

**presumably, she hands him or someone else her bag of holding so its not placed inside the other**

---

## General Store

We head across the street to the general store.  We see wanted posters.  Jaxxen uses sleight of hand to pull them down unnoticed and crumples them up in his pocket.

We enter a general store and Matheris buys 200 ft of silk rope for 50gp. Oli decides to go find a place where he can pick up some thieves tools and will meet back at the velvet curtain place on Merchant street. We get 2 grappling hooks and some pitons. Hereist gets some bedrolls and blankets. Jaxxen buys a lot of rations and 2 pouches and some utility belt straps.

On leaving, Matheris casts disguise self as needed. We take the back alleys to the velvet curtain store and make our way back into the Drunken Goblin

---

## Edwins Excursion

Edwin (still in cat form) exits the store and heads around to an alley. He changs back to normal. He whistles to a guard to attract him and runs off. Hes trying to evade the gaurd chasing him. Changes to a rat and heads into a hole in a door. He sees candle burning downstairs and steps leading up and a symbol on the wall he doesnt recognize.  Smelling nice food upstairs he goes up and hears voices talking quietly of some plan. Eventually he heads back to bardhome boulevard and rejoins the group.

---

## Return through Drunken Goblin

Jaxxen searches for the door to make ti revolve and we get up to the third floor.

A female half elf has robes on and there is a guard that appears to be private security.  She asks if we were here before and wants 8 gold pieces.  Jaxxen hands over 8gp for the group.  

Its night time and raining outside.  Oli gives a set of thieves tools to Matheris.

Before heading back to the lair, Jaxxen decides to get a fresh meal while Matheris checks the mirror door.  Jaxxen pays for Hereist, himself and Cobalt. We talk of battle and Cobalt has a fine set of chainmail that's been through battle charred from fire or acid. Cobalt looks up to the stage and takes a swig of ale. We try to be not obvious when we enter back into the mirror.

Matheris opens passage first and Jinxia will go with the last group showing Oli (he sure is a trusting one).  On the other side we see the paintings all show dark black.

## Back in the Lair

Matheris introduces Oli to Garth who has long white hair, solid black drow.  Oli asks him why he's helping us and Garth explains about him wanting to get down the passage.  Oli inquires as to why he wants to go back to the Underdark. Garth says he prefers it. Says the light hurts his eyes and for adventure. Him and Cobalt are adventurers sort and would rather go down then up.  Cobalt says he'll go anywhere with Garth. They help each other.

The party begins preparing for a long rest.

Jaxxen takes the opportunity t o test out shatter doing thunder damage away from the group before resting.  Edwin hids his pouch and swaps charm person for Darkvision. 

Garth wants to hear our plans. We talk of risks of using Bag of Holding to transport the people that can't make the distance. And how to communicate with the rope. We agree that short tugs on the rope will indicate "ok", and a serious of panic like fast tugs should mean "pull me back!"  Garth warns of the bends from pressure.  Edwin can breath under water and has goo swim speed. We tie 200 ft of rope to 50 ft from Jaxxen, and Hereist provides 100ft of silk rope for added length.  Edwin will go down and up and secure the rope on the other side before swmming back. We all gather around. Matheris sings bardic inspiration. Edwin casts pass without trace which gives a bonus to stealth checks.

## Underwater

Edwin enters the water and the water wier moves aside. Edwin pulls the rope with him. Some floor was nice stone then it drops deep. He goes a little and sees someone used something to notes 1117 in the flat stone under water.  Edwin knocks where the numbers are, but nothing happens. He continues down 40 more feet and another 40. He sees a small 6 inch white fish with white eyes, albino like. Maybe its blind.  Edwin casts speak with animals. He's able to communicate the fish and finds that there is some danger down at the bottom, to not go there.  He descends to the point where it begins going up on the other side. When he gets back to the surface, he nails rope to the floor with pitons and around a stalagmite and makes sure its extra tight before traversing back to the group.  Edwin relays the info about the fish and the danger below.

Oli and Jinxia cant make the distance without a potion of water breathing. Garth uses two diminution potions on Hereist and Cobalt who are wearing metal armor and shrinks them before putting them in his bag of holding.  Jaxxen takes a bag of holding with Matheris and Jinxia inside, tying it tight to prevent any chance of water from getting in and filling the bag.

**presumably, they each hand over their own bag of holding, and only get into one and the other is empty tied tight around Jaxxen's waist**

Garth enters slowly with bag of holding and follows Edwin the druid. Jaxxen and Oli are behind. At a low point all seems ok, but 6 seconds later there's bubbles rising. Jaxxen continues, traversing 15 feet per turn. It will take about 16 turns to cover the distance.

Garth and Edwin exit the water. Jaxxen gets to the surface and lets Matheris and Jinxia out of the bag. Garth does the same for Hereist and Cobalt. Jaxxen informs the group of the bubbles.

---

## The Other Side and Down

Garth shows a map he has to the group.  Cobalt and Hereist are still half sized from the potion they drank. This is a large cavern where a passage leads down but then gets jaggedy and rocky.

Matheris casts Dancing Lights so some of the group can see.

Jinxia gets down 60 foot and casts featherfall.

Edwin changes to a large spider form and carries Cobalt and Hereist on his back along with Matheris, Oli and Garth (seems way too much weight)

Jinxia is down 100 feet. Sees a cave below.  As the spider moves down Matheris moves the dancing lights with him.

Jaxxen takes a little falling damage from slipping and falling while climbing down.

When regrouped, we feel some airflow at a cut stone room. There are stairs leading down from here. We couldnt see them before as there was a door before.

Edwin heads down as a spider after dropping everyone off his back.  He hears something sliding around. Looks in room and sees large pillars. Its perhaps 50 or 60 feet wide, and about the same deep and tall.  He sees a creature walking on two legs but doesnt know what it is. Some Big creature with a big club, fastened with bone. He is dragging the club and is about 12 feet tall with greyish skin and big eyes, droopy face and a fat belly.

Meanwhile Matheris tried sending message to Edwin but the distance was too far to reach.

Edwin returns to the group and becomes half elf form. He relays what he saw. Matheris suggests the rogue leed looking for traps. Edwin will help Jinxia, Cobalt and Hereist. Oli and Jinxia will descend steps looking for traps.

## Down the Stairs to a Big Fat

Jinxia will do assist to help Oli in checking for traps. Edwin provides a non magic quarterstaff. They descend slowly at half speed and check about 10 times. The steps at the upper portion of the stairway are trap free, but they detect a trap at the mid point. Oli determines there is a pressure plate from his investigation. He takes the quarterstaff and wedges to prevent the pressure trap from activating. They find no more traps.

The party descends and Oli notes to the group where the trap is and recommends not stepping on it.  As Jaxxen approaches it, he decides to mark the wall area with an X above where the trap is for a visual reminder.

Oli gets to the bottom, peeks in and sees a door to the left, one to the right, and another straight ahead. He also notices a silhouette of a large bipedal with two arms, big and father and other part behind pillar.

Looking at the doors, two are about 9 foot tall, and one of them is about 15 foot tall.  

Garth begins preparing a spell.

Jaxxen attempts to ascertain the path the beast is taking but fails to stay quiet. He startles the creature who sees him.  Jaxxen promptly darts to hide behind another pillar.

Matheris comes down the stairs and attracts the beast. He calls out to him in greetings. The Beast moves toward Matheris who keeps talking. The Beast begins charging at Matheris.

Jinxia shoots with her bow and scores a critical hit for 17.  Oli attacks with his bow as well, hitting for 7.

The beast goes first and attacks Jaxxen, striking him with the club for 16. Jaxxen reacts with Hellish Rebuke, hitting for 3. Oli uses his bonus action to aim but misses (??). Jaxxen tries casting Witch Bolt, but misses before he moves away. Jinxia moves and gets true strike on next turn. Cobalt and Hereist stay back for now in their shrunken forms. Garth shoots three flames from his fingertips, and one of them hits the creature. Matheris gets to the beast and casts Thunderwave for 10 damage. Edwin casts create Bonfire on teh beast for 7 fire damage.

Oli aims and attacks for 18 damage felling the beast in his blood and causing an echo.

Jinxia pulls a scimitar and begins cutting its head off. There's more blood spewing out.

Jaxxen looks around the room. Sees the door to the right is taller. No inscriptions or symbols but there are about a dozen pillars and they are nicely built. He drinks a healing potion to regain 7 points, and Matheris also casts healing word on him for 7.

Jinxia keeps working on cutting the head.

Matheris checks if the door is unlocked with Mage Hand, but it doesnt open.

## Some Lizard Things

Oli searches the area of any other passages. He checks each door, listening for anything from other side.  When he gets to the left door he hears multiple things coming towards the door from footsteps.

We hide behind the pillars. The two fighters stay up the stairs a bet. We let Garth get a clear shot.

The door handle turns and opens a little bit. We hear a whisper but dont recognize the language. The door bursts open. A number of lizard like bipedals comes in with weapons, perhaps a dozen.  Garth casts a spell of fire toward the big group at the door. Many are on fire and dead. Somew that were coming in are fleeing down the hallway.

Matheris range attack and hits. Jaxxen casts Chill Touch hitting for 1 necrotic damage. Oli shoots and hits one killing it. Edwin casts create bonfire. The last one still alive. Jinxia runs after it. Jaxxen moves closer but the lizard guy gets into door and locks it.

We decide to retreat back up the stairway for now, setting trip lines before the pressure plate, and setup bells of string on steps to alert, as well as loose swords. There was no treasure on the lizards we killed.
