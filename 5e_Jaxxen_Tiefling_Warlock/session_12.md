_The group is in the library of the lair previously run by Zeldar_

A quick trip to the Drunken Goblin Tavern through the mirror, Jinxia finds Oli who she had met on a prior encounter with thieves cant.  He agrees to join our group, and we haul in yet one more rando to the "lair". He's quite trusting that Oli.

_Alliance with Garth_

Garth wants to form an alliance and has a map to the Underdark below murky water.  He detected a `crystal shard` in teh hallway carpet that was jammed into it. It can be used as a spell focus.  He also found books in the library about the paintings and the mirror.

Matheris demonstrates Magic Mouth as a way to create alarms around the lair.

Garth and Cobalt talk about the area below the water wier. They would really appreciate joining forces.

We discuss the portraits and the need to say `shut` and `open` in Undercommon to toggle them being locked or open.  Matheris and Garth know Undercommon and teach how to say these words to the rest of the party.  When the paintings are shut, they go dark and the mirror becomes a solid mirror.

The water below the water weir will dip about 100 feet down and then 100 feet back up.  This is quite the distance to swim as nobody has swimming speed and we'll be slowed. We need to hold our breath, but not all of us can make the distance without running out and suffocating. Garth indicates he has means to help some. There were the potions in the trunk. He also says he has credit with Malachi and we should prepare for a journey.

_Drunken Goblin and Oli_

The group gets ready to exit via the Drunken Goblin Tavern to head to Malachi's place.  Jaxxen changes appearance to that of a half elf. 

In the Drunken Goblin on the 3rd floor, Jinxia notices an elf she had met previously. There are bards playing blaring loud and well with shadows on the wall.  

Oli asks if we have any work. Jinxia nad Matheris talk to him about a potential perilous journey that we need to prepare for in a cave involving swimming.  Edwin leans in and asks Oli if he's seen any wanted posters with our faces on it. Oli indicates that he has seen some out for Matheris and Jinxia. When asked if Oli has any alignments with any guilds or groups, he indicates he's an independent.

Matheris listens to the bards play. Sees Delia and he nodes at her play. When she finishes, more louder bards get on stage.

We exit the Drunken Goblin out the VIP entrance to the secret shop with the velvet curtains which looks like an old art gallery.  Then take a left on Merchants and to Bard Home.

_Some Guards spot Us_

As we go around the Drunken Goblin Tavern, some guards are on the opposite side. Matheris casts silent image to appear as a human. Guards come looking and want us to show our faces. Edwin is initially not complying. Jinxia is hooded and begins drooling. An attempt to charm the guards is made by Edwin.

Guards are charmed and Edwin tells thm that the people they are looking for were in the Drunken Goblin Tavern.

Jaxxen casts invisibility on Jinxia.

Jinxia steps away from the group and attempts to cut the ties on a pouch of a passerby. She succeeds in getting the pouch.

Edwin gives a pouch of 2000gp to Matheris and changes shape into a cat.

Guards look at us and don't do anything.

We make it to Malachi's Weapons.

_Malachi's_

Cobalt leads us in to talk to Nade. Says "Need to speak to Ruger". Nade asks if he has an appointment.  Cobalt walks past, says "No" and starts walking up the stairs.  We follow him and notice Malachi's Armory across the way.  Ruger is a strong looking human with red hair who welcomes Cobalt.

We quickly find that we're unable to get any general supplies like silk rope or watertight armor here.

Matheris gets a rapier for Jinxia (rapier+1). Jinxia made her presence known and is no longer invisible.

Jinxia gets a bag of holding as does Matheris.  On the shelf behind Ruger is a hand crossbow but nobody wants it.

Ruger pulls out special arrows. Hereist and the Ranger say its nice in addition to Jinxia wanting it. Each want 4 of the special arrows. These are +1.  Ruger also has some special crossbow bolts, 6 of them in fact at +1.  

For Edwin, Matheris gets a quarterstaff of better quality and Oli gets a +1 rapier.  Hereist gets a +1 Longsword and a +1 mace for Ingrin. We go to leave and Matheris puts Jinxia in the bag of holding.

**presumably, she hands him or someone else her bag of holding so its not placed inside the other**

_General Store_

We head across the street to the general store.  We see wanted posters.  Jaxxen uses sleight of hand to pull them down unnoticed and crumples them up in his pocket.

We enter a general store and Matheris buys 200 ft of silk rope for 50gp. Oli decides to go find a place where he can pick up some thieves tools and will meet back at the velvet curtain place on Merchant street. We get 2 grappling hooks and some pitons. Hereist gets some bedrolls and blankets. Jaxxen buys a lot of rations and 2 pouches and some utility belt straps.

On leaving, Matheris casts disguise self as needed. We take the back alleys to the velvet curtain store and make our way back into the Drunken Goblin

_Edwins Excursion_

Edwin (still in cat form) exits the store and heads around to an alley. He changs back to normal. He whistles to a guard to attract him and runs off. Hes trying to evade the gaurd chasing him. Changes to a rat and heads into a hole in a door. He sees candle burning downstairs and steps leading up and a symbol on the wall he doesnt recognize.  Smelling nice food upstairs he goes up and hears voices talking quietly of some plan. Eventually he heads back to bardhome boulevard and rejoins the group.

---
_Return through Drunken Goblin_

Jaxxen searches for the door to make ti revolve and we get up to the third floor.

A female half elf has robes on and there is a guard that appears to be private security.  She asks if we were here before and wants 8 gold pieces.  Jaxxen hands over 8gp for the group.  

Its night time and raining outside.  Oli gives a set of thieves tools to Matheris.

Before heading back to the lair, Jaxxen decides to get a fresh meal while Matheris checks the mirror door.  Jaxxen pays for Hereist, himself and Cobalt. We talk of battle and Cobalt has a fine set of chainmail that's been through battle charred from fire or acid. Cobalt looks up to the stage and takes a swig of ale. We try to be not obvious when we enter back into the mirror.

Matheris opens passage first and Jinxia will go with the last group showing Oli (he sure is a trusting one).  On the other side we see the paintings all show dark black.

_Back in the Lair_

Matheris introduces Oli to Garth who has long white hair, solid black drow.  Oli asks him why he's helping us and Garth explains about him wanting to get down the passage.  Oli inquires as to why he wants to go back to the Underdark. Garth says he prefers it. Says the light hurts his eyes and for adventure. Him and Cobalt are adventurers sort and would rather go down then up.  Cobalt says he'll go anywhere with Garth. They help each other.

The party begins preparing for a long rest.

Jaxxen takes the opportunity t o test out shatter doing thunder damage away from the group before resting.  Edwin hids his pouch and swaps charm person for Darkvision. 

Garth wants to hear our plans. We talk of risks of using Bag of Holding to transport the people that can't make the distance. And how to communicate with the rope. We agree that short tugs on the rope will indicate "ok", and a serious of panic like fast tugs should mean "pull me back!"  Garth warns of the bends from pressure.  Edwin can breath under water and has goo swim speed. We tie 200 ft of rope to 50 ft from Jaxxen, and Hereist provides 100ft of silk rope for added length.  Edwin will go down and up and secure the rope on the other side before swmming back. We all gather around. Matheris sings bardic inspiration. Edwin casts pass without trace which gives a bonus to stealth checks.

Edwin enters the water and the water wier moves aside. Edwin pulls the rope with him. Some floor was nice stone then it drops deep. He goes a little and sees someone used something to notes 1117 in the flat stone under water.  Edwin knocks where the numbers are, but nothing happens. He continues down 40 more feet and another 40. He sees a small 6 inch white fish with white eyes, albino like. Maybe its blind.  Edwin casts speak with animals
