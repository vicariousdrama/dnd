<i>Ingrin is a new character introduced to the group and we have a brief recap that we are in the City of Nostry in the great Realm of Nostr. Nostr is the largest city, and within are several thieves guilds, heavily populated. We've had various run-ins over time, even running from the City Guards. During the last session, we had left off getting supplies and stayed at the Oreo Inn.</i>

## Day 13

From our two rooms, the party awakens, gathers out things and checks out. We decide to eat a hearty meal at the The Owl Tavern next door and then head to teh church on Barley street in the hopes of replenishing our healing potions if available.

When Jinxia and Matheris come down Matheris shows that he's no longer wearing his armor, and instead has gold scales on his skin. Matheris tells of his ancestry and claims that there is some dragon aspects and it could have been triggered by the poison he recently endured.  Jaxxen suggests it could be fish scales, but Matheris insists he was also able to understand some of Nathair's Draconic speech while he was praying.

We all pay for our breakfast and head out to Barley street. Jaxxen takes on the appearance of a human. On the way, Matheris and Edwin talk of disguises and Edwin puts a hand up and indicate some circle of the moon as diety. We see clouds starting to form overhead as though it may rain later, but still sunny.

After turning on Barley and approaching the church, we see two statues of war dogs. Inside the worshippers have white robes with purple and blue trim. When we enquire of any healing potions the person assisting us indicates that they only have one available and are asking 55gp for it.

A cleric named Ingrin is watching us and knows that there are some more potions in stock but other people may need them.  

Written in the stone above is something about "Justice must be obtained"

Matheris is rambling to the staff member hoping to convince them to sell us more or find out what we can do to help them make more potions.  Jaxxen says "Sometimes Justice is doing things that others won't to make things right"

Ingrin seems a little impressed by the fancy words and tells the group that if we're looking for help in persuing justice, that she could help.

Matheris asks if she's seen combat before and she responds that she and her hammer have probably seen much more then all of us put together and her hammer has never failed her. Shes got the scars to prove it.  Jaxxen likes the sound of something that never fails.  Matheris offers to buy lunch.  Jinxia purchases the healing potion for 55gp. Ingrin considers getting more. Matheris thinks we need more and he also pulls out another potion he found on our adventures. Ingrin looks at it, swirling it around. She thinkgs its stronger than the church has been making typically.  Ingrin convinces the clerk to sell a few more potions to the party. Hereist and Jaxxen both buy one.

We leave with Ingrin joining us and head to her favorite tavern nearby. A place called Séimí's. Inside there is a bard playing a nice peaceful song on a lute. She orders 2 ales, the board stew with meat and potatoes. Edwin wants to try the boar stew and Jaxxen has some as well.  Ingrin explains to us that she has seen a lot of battle in the past as a soldier. And for a time she became a blacksmith but it just wasn't as fulfilling. So her calling now is in the service of Tyr fighting for justice.  Jinxia chimes in that she heard that "If we don't leave the world a better place, at least leave it with a fuller coinpurse".  Jaxxen states that "Jinxia is a specialized acquirer of goods and sometimes takes things personally". Matheris tells of the encounters with thieves in a tavern and others as part of the casket nails. Ingrin hasn't had any such run-ins.  The owner comes over and brings fresh loaves of bread and butter.  Jaxxen asks Ingrin if the church itself has any needs to support Justice. Ingrin says could check in with other clerics at the church. Matheris talks of the sewers and goblins and Ingrin doesnt believe it.  The conversation continues

Tavern doors open and city guards sit at a table and glance at us. Matheris and Jaxxen message each other to stay calm and casual. The conversation continues and after a bit the doors slam open again and a middle aged woman pleads with the guards that there is an emergency and they are needed.  Edwin steps outside to keep an eye on where the guards went, and Ingrin steps out to see if someone can use her aid. See people gathering outside some government buildings across the street, a half elf on the ground, possibly unconscious.  Ingrin offers to heal the man, she leanss down and tries healing. Moves the body and sees slits in his cloak on the back as someone stabbed him twice. She casts cure wounds and completely heals him. He's some high up officer working for the city and the guards thank Ingrin. Ingrin is surprised at the violence that happened. 

### The Bookstore

Jaxxen looks around to see if noticed anyone shady. Edwin looks for wanted posters and sees a fighters guild across the way.  By the bookstore and library see a man in a hooded gray robes with someone wearing armor on. Commoners walking buy. People all just looking and gradually dispersing. Edwin notices that by the cemetary someone by the fence is putting up a chain and lock on big gates. Matheris goes to the gates and acts out that he can't even get in to mourn someone. The man that locked it up is moving quickly away down Spice street. the sign on the gate says "Closed for Maintenance". Edwin moves into an alley, sends his hawk off to follow from the skies while he shapeshifts into a cat. He runs around and through alleys and eventually sees the man circle back around and step into a door in the back of the bookstore.  Meanwhile, Jaxxen inspects the area around the cemetary to see if its all cobblestone around the perimeter or any dirt, and Matheris, Jinxia, and Ingrin decide to head across the street to the bookstore. Matheris and Ingrin head inside while Jinxia wants to try to climb the building around the backside.

Inside the library, Ingrin finds a section that is roped off with an "Off Limits" sign. Enquires about it and the staff there tell her that its just because the books haven't been reviewed and priced yet. Ingrin asks for books on the history of the city and is referred to a section dedicated to it. Edwin heads inside looking around and asks if they have any books on the sewers. The staff member thinks thats odd but does find a book, brings it but its just the cover as the insides have been ripped out. The staff member then shows it to anotehr and they discuss it. Matheris asks about political scandals and is referred to the government buildings for such records.  Hereist head into the library and notices the dark elf and guy in chain mail that they talked to before at The Owl Tavern. He returns and informs Jaxxen. Jaxxen considers waiting outside and following them when they depart.  Matheris recognized the dark elf as well and heads over to him. Introduces himself and goes on a lengthy conversation giving up information about the party, and eventually exchanging the golden statue he picked up in the area beneath the cemetary in exchange for information on how to get through the door that has no handle. The dark elf tells him and that it will also get more dangerous.  Meanwhhile, Edwin looks for the back door, finds two. He looks for the man that went in and must be here amongst the people. He finds a bookshelf that looks somewhat different from others, especially after examining the floor seeing some marks rubbing. He finds Ingrin and describes it to her. Ingrin thinks it could open a passage. Edwin considers we could do when store is closed. He feels for a draft but there is none. Ingrin and Edwin investigate. Jinxia hiding behing trash outside the building. Edwin opens door and calls her and she hears him. She hadn't even checked the door knobs to see if unlocked. She comes inside to look at the bookshelves.

Jaxxen and Hereist are still at the cemetary and hear a sound like stone or footsteps and movement at a bush. They check the perimeter to see if there is a way that they could get in, each going in opposite directions around and meeting on the opposite side.

Matheris continues talking to the dark elf and finds that he knows of Zeldar. Is not friends with him.

Jaxxen and Hereist decide to go to the book store. They find the rest of the group and relay what they noticed of a bush moving. Edwin finds Matheris and tells him of the bookshelf. The man he was following earlier is nowhere to be found.  They start pulling on books and it clicks. Jaxxen notices and sees the book named "Ocean Waves". A staff person is ringing a bell indicating the store is closing in 15 minutes. We get the bookshelf open and we are in a 10x10 space with the bookshelf closed back up. Its at the corner of the book store where two of the walls are exterior stone and the other two walls of this enclosure are the back of the bookshelves. Looking on floor see a rug with tassles. Edwin pulls it and sees a wooden door underneath.  We hear the library workers lock up. Jinxia checks the wooden door for traps and identifies a needle trap with a keyhole and recessed handle. Jaxxen pulls out a dagger and suggests just triggering it t o disable. Matheris uses his longsword instead.   After opening the wooden door, Ingrin leads with Hereist down the steps to a metal door.

### Going Down to Goblin Town

Matheris triggers a trap on this door and many arrows shoot out injuring Jinxia while others evade, dodging or arrows hitting shields. Matheris heals Jinxia.  The door wont open. Its locked. With the assistance of Guidance and bardic inspiration, Jinxia manages to pick the lock. Opening the door an arrow flies and strikes her from the other side. Edwin hears goblins shouting "Intruders!" and hears running towards us. Jaxxen slams door shut with Thaumaturgy. We back up and take positions. Door knob starts turning. Matheris wants us to get behind him. Jaxxen gets up the stairs with Edwin. Ingrin asks why. Matheris casts Thunderwave and the door slames open hard, arrows come straight for Matheris. But the shock of thunderwave did a lot of damage.  Edwin casts Create Bofire on them. Jaxxen descends steps to get a clear shot and fires his crossbow. Ingrin casts Toll the Dead on one doing lots of necrotic damage.  Jinxia stabbed one with a rapier and retreated.

There are a number of things on other side of door and 2 arrows come flying in hitting Hereist and Matheris. Jinxia sees a shit ton of goblins, estimates like 25 all with short bows. She runs, hits one, and runs back. Another arrow comes at Hereist but misses, along with another. One misses and strikes a fellow goblin instead killing it. Jaxxen misses with his crossbow. Edwin casts Fog Cloud on the goblin group and runs back. Arrows fire en masse from the goblins. Hereist is hit. Hereist runs into the edge of the Fog Cloud swinging and hits two of them killing one by cutting it in half. Ingrin goes to the edge of the Fog Cloud and uses her war hammer on the goblins she finds smashing ones head in. With a bonus attack hits another killing it.  More arrows come firing from the Fog Cloud with disadvantage. Only one hits Jaxxen while several others miss everyone.  Matheris runs to the edge and casts Thunderwave. Several goblins die in the process. Edwin continues concentrating on the Fog. Jinxia enters the Fog Cloud, senses something and attacks and hits. Arrows flie from the cloud. One hits Hereist. Hereist rushes in swing longsword, misses and runs back. More arrows miss. Ingrin misses with her war hammer but calls upon Channel Divinity. The war hammer whips into a goblin and kills it. Then War Priest hits for 7 killing it and backs up. Matheris suggests lifting the Fog and runs in with Longsword swinging and missing. Goblins are retreating. Edwin hears the call of them to retreat. He drops the fog. We see 3 goblins. He casts Create Bonfire on them and they die.  

We look over the bodies of the goblins find some copper and silver and hand it to Ingrin. Jinxia grabs some arrows that she finds. Hereist heals himself. Jaxxen looks down passage and sees hobgoblin looking up who sees him at same time. Jaxxen quickly fires and strikes it dead center in its forehead, killing it dead. Matheris positions behind a pillar facing the opening down the stairs. The room is 20 sx 20 with 5 pillars in an x type arrangement.  Jaxxen runs down part way, doesnt see anything and runs up. Casts invisibility on self. When run down sees that there are two hobgoblins waiting on either side at bottom with swords drawn in ready position.  He scouts out the other rooms and takes cover behind a door.  Uses Message to inform Matheris of the layout who relays to the group up top.  And another message saying he plans to shoot at the one on his left (their right as they come down the stairs). Matheris gets ready with Dancing Lights in human shape. As soon as it goes int othe room the Hobgoblins swing in the air at it.  Jaxxen fires his crossbow and misses, but then takes cover behind the door. Hereist shoots and misses. Jinxia misses. Edwin casts Create Bonfire. Ingrin casts Toll the Dead doing damage.

The Hobgoblin strikes Jaxxen for damage but Armor of Agathys deals 10 cold damage in retaliation killing it.  The other hobgoblin falls down the stairs. Matheris uses shocking grasp on it electrocuting it with lightning. Ingrin hits with her war hammer. The hobgoblin is still alive. And Edwin then points his staff at him, speaks in goblin, telling him hes outnumbererd and to surrender. The hobgoblin surrenders and Edwin informs the group of such.

Hereist puts the hobgoblin longsword behind back so he can't use it.  Meanwhile Jaxxen searches the hobgoblin he killed and splits the spoils with Jinxia for coming to his aid. Edwin finds some gold on the hobgoblin and splits with Ingrin.  The surrendered hobgoblin is tied up and propped on the door opposite the bunk rooms.

The door handle starts to turn and when it opens a goblin walks in surprised. Matheris hits the goblin with fire. Jaxxen messages the goblin saying "its all over now". Edwin burns the goblin to death.

In interogating the hobgoblin we find that he works for Zeldar and Zeldar is his master and owns the Deep, and everything down here. And Master will kill him painfullly. Informs us that Zeldar kills with magic, fire, lightning.  Henceforth will treat Edwin or Matheris as Master. Edwin tells him that he should fall in the ranks and report back everything that he knows. When asked if he knows of any dark elves, he only knows of Zeldar. Asked about the war gong he says it is the alamr to attack. Zeldar recruits from various places and has quite an army lower down. Asked which door they come from the hobgoblin points to the door with no handle that we haven't opene3d yet. Matheris lets the hobgoblin go and heals him some.  The Party discusses plans for a short rest to heal and gain spell slots. We hear knocking at the door with teh goblin. Goblin speaks "Whats going on". We tell the hobgoblin to go through the door and we hide. Hear shuffing then some steps leaving. We barricade the door with some furnishings inside and proceed to setup bells on string across passages and doors and get into rooms for a rest.
