<i>Ingrid is a new character introduced to the group and we have a brief recap that we are in the City of Nostry in the great Realm of Nostr. Nostr is the largest city, and within are several thieves guilds, heavily populated. We've had various run-ins over time, even running from the City Guards. During the last session, we had left off getting supplies and stayed at the Oreo Inn.</i>

## Day 13

From our two rooms, the party awakens, gathers out things and checks out. We decide to eat a hearty meal at the The Owl Tavern next door and then head to teh church on Barley street in the hopes of replenishing our healing potions if available.

When Jinxia and Matheris come down Matheris shows that he's no longer wearing his armor, and instead has gold scales on his skin. Matheris tells of his ancestry and claims that there is some dragon aspects and it could have been triggered by the poison he recently endured.  Jaxxen suggests it could be fish scales, but Matheris insists he was also able to understand some of Nathair's Draconic speech while he was praying.

We all pay for our breakfast and head out to Barley street. Jaxxen takes on the appearance of a human. On the way, Matheris and Edwin talk of disguises and Edwin puts a hand up and indicate some circle of the moon as diety. We see clouds starting to form overhead as though it may rain later, but still sunny.

After turning on Barley and approaching the church, we see two statues of war dogs. Inside the worshippers have white robes with purple and blue trim. When we enquire of any healing potions the person assisting us indicates that they only have one available and are asking 55gp for it.

A cleric named Ingrid is watching us and knows that there are some more potions in stock but other people may need them.  

Written in the stone above is something about "Justice must be obtained"

Matheris is rambling to the staff member hoping to convince them to sell us more or find out what we can do to help them make more potions.  Jaxxen says "Sometimes Justice is doing things that others won't to make things right"

Ingrid seems a little impressed by the fancy words and tells the group that if we're looking for help in persuing justice, that she could help.

Matheris asks if she's seen combat before and she responds that she and her hammer have probably seen much more then all of us put together and her hammer has never failed her. Shes got the scars to prove it.  Jaxxen likes the sound of something that never fails.  Matheris offers to buy lunch.  Jinxia purchases the healing potion for 55gp. Ingrid considers getting more. Matheris thinks we need more and he also pulls out another potion he found on our adventures. Ingrid looks at it, swirling it around. She thinkgs its stronger than the church has been making typically.  Ingrid convinces the clerk to sell a few more potions to the party. Hereist and Jaxxen both buy one.

We leave with Ingrid joining us and head to her favorite tavern nearby. A place called Séimí's. Inside there is a bard playing a nice peaceful song on a lute. She orders 2 ales, the board stew with meat and potatoes. Edwin wants to try the boar stew and Jaxxen has some as well.  Ingrid explains to us that she has seen a lot of battle in the past as a soldier. And for a time she became a blacksmith but it just wasn't as fulfilling. So her calling now is in the service of Tyr fighting for justice.
