<i>Ingrid is a new character introduced to the group and we have a brief recap that we are in the City of Nostry in the great Realm of Nostr. Nostr is the largest city, and within are several thieves guilds, heavily populated. We've had various run-ins over time, even running from the City Guards. During the last session, we had left off getting supplies and stayed at the Oreo Inn.</i>

## Day 13

From our two rooms, the party awakens, gathers out things and checks out. We decide to eat a hearty meal at the The Owl Tavern next door and then head to teh church on Barley street in the hopes of replenishing our healing potions if available.

When Jinxia and Matheris come down Matheris shows that he's no longer wearing his armor, and instead has gold scales on his skin. Matheris tells of his ancestry and claims that there is some dragon aspects and it could have been triggered by the poison he recently endured.  Jaxxen suggests it could be fish scales, but Matheris insists he was also able to understand some of Nathair's Draconic speech while he was praying.

We all pay for our breakfast and head out to Barley street. Jaxxen takes on the appearance of a human. On the way, Matheris and Edwin talk of disguises and Edwin puts a hand up and indicate some circle of the moon as diety. We see clouds starting to form overhead as though it may rain later, but still sunny.

After turning on Barley and approaching the church, we see two statues of war dogs. Inside the worshippers have white robes with purple and blue trim. When we enquire of any healing potions the person assisting us indicates that they only have one available and are asking 55gp for it.

A cleric named Ingrid is watching us and knows that there are some more potions in stock but other people may need them.  

Written in the stone above is something about "Justice must be obtained"

Matheris is rambling to the staff member hoping to convince them to sell us more or find out what we can do to help them make more potions.  Jaxxen says "Sometimes Justice is doing things that others won't to make things right"

Ingrid seems a little impressed by the fancy words and tells the group that if we're looking for help in persuing justice, that she could help.

Matheris asks if she's seen combat before and she responds that she and her hammer have probably seen much more then all of us put together and her hammer has never failed her. Shes got the scars to prove it.  Jaxxen likes the sound of something that never fails.  Matheris offers to buy lunch.  Jinxia purchases the healing potion for 55gp. Ingrid considers getting more. Matheris thinks we need more and he also pulls out another potion he found on our adventures. Ingrid looks at it, swirling it around. She thinkgs its stronger than the church has been making typically.  Ingrid convinces the clerk to sell a few more potions to the party. Hereist and Jaxxen both buy one.

We leave with Ingrid joining us and head to her favorite tavern nearby. A place called Séimí's. Inside there is a bard playing a nice peaceful song on a lute. She orders 2 ales, the board stew with meat and potatoes. Edwin wants to try the boar stew and Jaxxen has some as well.  Ingrid explains to us that she has seen a lot of battle in the past as a soldier. And for a time she became a blacksmith but it just wasn't as fulfilling. So her calling now is in the service of Tyr fighting for justice.  Jinxia chimes in that she heard that "If we don't leave the world a better place, at least leave it with a fuller coinpurse".  Jaxxen states that "Jinxia is a specialized acquirer of goods and sometimes takes things personally". Matheris tells of the encounters with thieves in a tavern and others as part of the casket nails. Ingrid hasn't had any such run-ins.  The owner comes over and brings fresh loaves of bread and butter.  Jaxxen asks Ingrid if the church itself has any needs to support Justice. Ingrid says could check in with other clerics at the church. Matheris talks of the sewers and goblins and Ingrid doesnt believe it.  The conversation continues

Tavern doors open and city guards sit at a table and glance at us. Matheris and Jaxxen message each other to stay calm and casual. The conversation continues and after a bit the doors slam open again and a middle aged woman pleads with the guards that there is an emergency and they are needed.  Edwin steps outside to keep an eye on where the guards went, and Ingrid steps out to see if someone can use her aid. See people gathering outside some government buildings across the street, a half elf on the ground, possibly unconscious.  Ingrid offers to heal the man, she leanss down and tries healing. Moves the body and sees slits in his cloak on the back as someone stabbed him twice. She casts cure wounds and completely heals him. He's some high up officer working for the city and the guards thank Ingrid. Ingrid is surprised at the violence that happened. 

### The Bookstore

Jaxxen looks around to see if noticed anyone shady. Edwin looks for wanted posters and sees a fighters guild across the way.  By the bookstore and library see a man in a hooded gray robes with someone wearing armor on. Commoners walking buy. People all just looking and gradually dispersing. Edwin notices that by the cemetary someone by the fence is putting up a chain and lock on big gates. Matheris goes to the gates and acts out that he can't even get in to mourn someone. The man that locked it up is moving quickly away down Spice street. the sign on the gate says "Closed for Maintenance". Edwin moves into an alley, sends his hawk off to follow from the skies while he shapeshifts into a cat. He runs around and through alleys and eventually sees the man circle back around and step into a door in the back of the bookstore.  Meanwhile, Jaxxen inspects the area around the cemetary to see if its all cobblestone around the perimeter or any dirt, and Matheris, Jinxia, and Ingrid decide to head across the street to the bookstore. Matheris and Ingrid head inside while Jinxia wants to try to climb the building around the backside.

Inside the library, Ingrid finds a section that is roped off with an "Off Limits" sign. Enquires about it and the staff there tell her that its just because the books haven't been reviewed and priced yet. Ingrid asks for books on the history of the city and is referred to a section dedicated to it. Edwin heads inside looking around and asks if they have any books on the sewers. The staff member thinks thats odd but does find a book, brings it but its just the cover as the insides have been ripped out. The staff member then shows it to anotehr and they discuss it. Matheris asks about political scandals and is referred to the government buildings for such records.  Hereist head into the library and notices the dark elf and guy in chain mail that they talked to before at The Owl Tavern. He returns and informs Jaxxen. Jaxxen considers waiting outside and following them when they depart.  Matheris recognized the dark elf as well and heads over to him. Introduces himself and goes on a lengthy conversation giving up information about the party, and eventually exchanging the golden statue he picked up in the area beneath the cemetary in exchange for information on how to get through the door that has no handle. The dark elf tells him and that it will also get more dangerous.  Meanwhhile, Edwin looks for the back door, finds two. He looks for the man that went in and must be here amongst the people. He finds a bookshelf that looks somewhat different from others, especially after examining the floor seeing some marks rubbing. He finds Ingrid and describes it to her. Ingrid thinks it could open a passage. Edwin considers we could do when store is closed. He feels for a draft but there is none. Ingrid and Edwin investigate. Jinxia hiding behing trash outside the building. Edwin opens door and calls her and she hears him. She hadn't even checked the door knobs to see if unlocked. She comes inside to look at the bookshelves.

Jaxxen and Hereist are still at the cemetary and hear a sound like stone or footsteps and movement at a bush. They check the perimeter to see if there is a way that they could get in, each going in opposite directions around and meeting on the opposite side.
