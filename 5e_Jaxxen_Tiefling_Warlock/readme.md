# Notes

# Session 1 - Seeking the Tower of Umar

## Day 1

Jaxxen the warlock and Matheris the bard gather some additional supplies before setting out from Frizgate towards the great city of Nostr. En route they recall legends of a stone tower that used to be present on a side route. While slightly out of the way, Jaxxen and Matheris agree to see if they can locate it and check it out.  Its supposed to be into the woods 150-200 feet from the road, where there are three noticeable weathered stones on the side, with one darker then the others.  The name is the Tower of Uram.  It could be unsafe, but there could be riches as there was a well off person of nobility there. Matheris has with him Jinxia, a small halfling that hides in the pack of a mule named Serafina.  Before leaving, Jinxia successfully steals some rations, and Jaxxen decides to buy some outright.  At the end of the day we rest, each of us taking a watch.  On Jaxxens watch, he holds his wrist periodically and looks to the sky considering the night serpent in his vision.

## Day 2

We each eat rations in the morning. There are no specific events this day. Some wind, big clouds in the sky. Calm and peaceful. Dirt and gravel on the road, and some bigger smaller boulders.  The forest is present on boths sides with tall trees.  We see a horse with saddle, but no rdier. Not connected bridle behind and eating grass. Materis goes to the horse and sees the saddle is bloody. Examining the blood, it seems to be either elf or half-elf blood, about a day old.  Jaxxen suggests we press on, and walks the mule Serafina with Matheris on the horse. We make camp and Jaxxen takes the second watch. Rubs his wrist, and Matheris notices it.  Jaxxen thought he saw something above the clouds for just a moment, but then it was gone.

## Day 3

We eat rations in the morning and the clouds over head are the same, big and puffy. We remember about the three stones we need to be looking for. Soon, arrows fly towards us from up the road. Matheris has cover behind the horse but tries to take cover behind rocks on the left side and stumbles. Serafina the mule ends up taking an arrow to the abdomen while moving to the left side of the road and is wounded.  Jaxxen quickly drops behind a rock on the right side.  We hear noises in the distance, and think we're about 180 feet away.  Matheris tries to be clever, using mage hand to carry a stick towards the noise, but doesnt attract any fire. But we see a hooded figure with a longbow and leather armor taking aim. As we dash from rock to rock, archer draws again and we see another draw a bow.  Not sure how many, could be 2? 3?. Jinxia thinks its a half-orc but shrugs uncertain. Matheris decides to hop back on the road and plee that we mean no harm. Ends up being hit with an arrow in response.  At this point Jaxxen knows this was no accidental strike, and immediately fires his crossbow toward the figure, hitting him.  Matheris then gets behind a boulder. We notice a third figure come out of the woods. Matheris hits and does damage with Jinxia cheering him on. Jinxia attempts but misses and ducks. One of the orcs was on his back. Jinxia hits it. The orc shouts at Matheris and hits him.  Saw some shuffling movement behind the boulder where they are.  Jaxxen hit the orc and then runs for the boulder. Matheris moves towards the orcs and Jinxia readies for another shot.  One of the half-orcs disengages and makes a break for the woods.  We see the remaining half orce bloodied mouth and badly injured. Jaxxen demands his told and he says its on his side. Jaxxen reaches for it, but notices the orc grabbing his dagger. Jaxxen quickly fires a crossbow bolt but misses. Jaxxen is hit by the dagger for a small damage. Matheris rushes in with longsword, but stumbles and misses. Jinxia saves us hitting for enough damage to kill this dastardly being.  Jaxxen takes the pouch, sees the coin inside, grabs 3 gold and hands them to Matheris. Matheris in turn hands some to Jinxia.  Jaxxen decides to try to pursue the one that got away while Matheris rounds up the horse and mule.  Jaxxen follows the blood trail but after a while loses the trail and decides to return to Matheris.  Matheris is having a bit of difficulty rounding up the beasts. Jaxxen catches up to Serafina and succeeds at calming her and removing the arrow from her side. She's heavily wounded and still bleeding. Jaxxen has nothing to stop the bleeding. Its getting dark. Matheris fully heals Jaxxen.  We see the three stones on the ground and decide we should make camp around here. The stones are exactly is it was told it would be.

## Day 4

We eat rations and were fully healed over night.  Matheris heals the mule Serafina.  We investigate and look at rocks in the field. Jinxia notices more in a distance in the forest. Most are stone from the tower on the ground. Buried in the earth somewhat from years of weathering. Centuries.  We see a stagnant puddle of water about 30x40 foot that is green on one side, sick swampy like, and a tree off to the distance.  Looking close at the stones under bushes we see a wooden doors of some type.  Jaxxen thinks the door may be trapped. Jinxia takes a closer look and sees a trap line to a spikey log overhead.  Not sure how to disarm it, Jaxxen concocts a plan to trigger it. We all step clear of the trap and Jaxxen throws his spear at the door. It hits solid and causes the trap to trigger. A big limb with spikes swooshes down crashing with heavy force into the tree and stops. Its clear that if we were there, we'd be dead.  Matheris throws a rock at the door. Nothing else happens.  The spear is destroyed.  Jinxia doesnt see any more traps.  The door is a double oak door with a keyhole. It's about 4x6 foor and into side old stone same as the tower. Offset about 70 to 80 feet and at an angle.  Jaxxen decides to try to just open the door. Its unlocked! It opens with ease.  Holding the door open, he welcomes the party to step inside.  Within its dark. And steep. Too step for the horse and mule. We quickly tie them up outside to the tree, and venture within.  The air is moist wet air kind of mildewy. It's not evil, but offseting. Inside its dark. Jinxia is a halfling and can't see. We are guiding with Matheris in front, Jaxxen middle and Jinxia to the rear. Jaxxen pulls out pen and parchment and works on trying to draw a map of their progress down the slope. We get down a ways and nothing happens. There's an entry to a room ahead 40 feet down. Jaxxen tries throwing some sand to see if it triggers anything. Nothing happens. Matheris attempts with a single ball bearing. It bounces into the room and must have hit a wall as it comes back towards the steps.  We go into the room, about 25 ft. See several bedrolls, some furniture. Food and drink look like someone was recently here. Jaxxen checks the corner for any feces or droppings and finds none. Just mildewy. Jaxxen convinced its nothing like goblins or other wretched creatures, but could be worse if its like cultists.  When entering the room, another wooden door was noticed. Vertical ahead. 2-3 people had to have put a boulder in front of the door to try to keep something in.  We see hooded robes from the half-orc with blood on it. Its then that we notice the blood trail splatter that had gone up the stairs. Matheris checks it over and suggests its about 6 hours to a day old. Very recent. Jaxxen convinced this is the orc that fled into the forest the previous day.

**_Technical Intermission_**

With the big tree limb and boulder against the door, we scour the rest of the room. We don't find much of anything apart from a silver piece with Jaxxen promptly pockeets. There's no papers or potions, nor do we find any traps. The room is about 10 feet high, and 30x30 in dimensions. And we had come down about 40 foot of steps.  Looking at big log/tree stump blocking the door we decide to try to push it out of the way.  The boulder proves a bit more challenging, taking all of our might several times and using bits of furniture to slowly move it enough out of the way that we could open the door. Before doing so, Jaxxen does a Thaumaturgy cantrip to cause tremors in the ground and the party listens for any movement on the other side. We hear nothing. We move the boulder the rest of the way and Jinxia tries looking through the keyhole of this wooden door with iron hinges. She also sees nothing and notices no traps, but indicates the door is unlocked. Jaxxen pulls the cloth from under the door and all at once the smell of decaying matter wafts in, quite the bad odor. Slowly opening the door, Jaxxen motions for Matheris and Jinxia to enter. The floor and side of wall has a cave in. Think its from green murky pool from up on the surface. On ride side of wall there is a hallway that continues. Jaxxen updates his map.

They didnt inject any fluids but hurt Matheris badly. Then a mandible like head overhead. This beast is large, about 5 feet wide and 15 feet long, like a centipede of some sort Jaxxen notices whats going on and fires his light crossbow at the mandible part. Jinxia jumps up off the shoulders of Matheris to get reach and pierces the creature with a rapier. Matheris swings with a longsword. Throughout the battle damage is taken on both sides and at one point Jinxia is hit, and goes limp. Jaxxen is near death and makes a desperate attempt to grab Jinxia and pull her back into the room we came from. With success, Jaxxen and Jinxia is out of reach of the cenitipede while Matheris battles on and hits it good.  With each hit the centipede screeches in pain. Jaxxen fires a shot through the door, but misses the monstrosity. With a final blow, Matheris hits it again and the creature begins falling from the ceiling. Matheris promptly ducks out of the way!

Hearing the ruckus of the cenitpedes demise, Jaxxen shouts "Go ahead and loot this one, I'll get the next", and tries to tend to Jinxia but has no potions to offer. Matheris looks over the organic matter of stomach matter and sees tunnel from the right wall, brown boots in the muck and a decaying hand among other waste.  He checks out the boots seeing they are finely made, perhaps elven and in good shape.  He notices something else shiny. There could have been a handful of victims in here over time. Matheris finds a finely crafted dagger and a stainless steel canister and takes them both.

The party takes a short rest in the room outside the muck. As a result, Jaxxen is mostly healed, and the poison affecting Jinxia starts to wear off naturally. We consider strategies and potentially returning up the stairs going to town and hiring a mercenary to help us.  Soon after we hear a noise up the steps. Something is on top of the door we came in. There's voices but Jaxxen can't quite make it out. We investigate and think the log trap was reset and triggerd on top of the door as the light is blocked and we cant move it.  We hear the mule and horse going off in the distance and think they've been stolen. Matheris is panicing about his pack animals and we try to think of ways out. With the door weighted we cant budge it. It would take too long to burn it with fire, and we'd suffocate in the process. 

Matheris does some herbalism on Jinxia healing her more and tells Jaxxen and Jinxia about the boots. Jaxxen takes a look and says that they are boots of elvenkind! The wearer makes no sound from steps and it gives advantage on dexterity checks.  Jinxia equips the boots.  We check back downstairs at the tunnel and hallway. Tunnel has bodies rotted over time and redigested. ugh. Comes out the right side where stone gave way. Hallway on the other side is of proper stone built with the right side caved in. We see that it opens up into another room. 

This room is 30 by 30 feet, but noticeably taller then others, about 13 feet tall.  Jaxxen uses his steel mirror to look around entry through room and sees door to the right and across the way, along with some furnishings. Its a stone room thats very old. We go in the room. Jaxxen looks at the door across the way and sees that it is orante markings with the word "URAM" script. The other door in the room also has markings, but in a language that nobody her understands.  There's also some fancy lantern hooks on the wall, and Jaxxen suggests that these lanterns are more useful for seeing than the candle that Jinxia has been carrying around. He grabs one and hands it to Jinxia, and then pours some oil from a flask in it. Jinxia lights it with her candle and the room is lit up bright.

The furniture here is very ornate. Like curio cabinets and such. Jaxxen investigates them. Most are empty, just dust for the most part but on the upper shelf of one, Jaxxen finds a ring. It seems to have magical markings in nature but Jaxxen can't make it out and decides to pocket it.  Matheris notices and asks about it. Jaxxen hands the ring over and says .. "Do you want to try it on?". Matheris hesitates and hands it back. The ring is gold in color, has markings, but none of us know what it does.  We'll check it out when we get to the city.  There's also a large mirror in this room about 7 feet tall and 4 feet wide, unbroken, and apart from some dust coating its in perfect condition, affixed to the wall. Jaxxen taps it with his dagger and it holds up.  Looking at the door marked "UMAR", find it locked. Jinxia works on it and manages to unlock it and didn't detect any traps.  Jaxxen pulls the door open. Looking through the door its all manner of busted stones and rubble from the ruins of the tower blocking access. Its completely impassable.  Jaxxen states "Guess we're not going that way" and motions to the other door.  We ask Jinxia to take a look to see if its trapped. She says there's no traps and she unlocks it as well.  Jaxxen tells people to clear to the side from the door and he attempts to open it with haste. 

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/8/8f/Basilisk1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190616192630" align="right" width="120" />Its then that there is a sound on the other side of the door. Sounds like walking. heavy steps and growls of huge gutteral voice coming toward us.  Jaxxen suggests a quick plan. If we put the lantern in the center of the room the whole room will be lit well and Jinxia will have her hands free in case we need to fight. And then we can get on the wall on the side of the door to limit visibility of whatevers coming to us.  The beast gets to the door. Only some of us are able to hide.  It looks in to the left and right but doesnt see us on the sides. Matheris casts prestidigation to make a smell ahead in the room to distract the beast. Its this large big headed thing with scales and horns and spike tail.  The smell succesfully draws the beast further in, and we take the opportunity to quickly get in behind the beast. Matheris and Jaxxen make it, but Jinxia touches her foot on the beasts tail.  The creature turns quickly, and now its tail is in the room.  We high tail it up this corridor to the next area planning to hide. We get to a cavernous area with stalagtites and stalagmites. Looking around we see statues of people in pain on the ground in contorted shapes and some appear to have bites in them.  Jaxxen thinks they were living people turned to stone while running away from something attacking them.  Now there is silence. The creature isn't moving.  Matheris thinks back to the enocunter and remembers a creature that could turn stuff to stone. Jaxxen suggests it could be a minotaur? or a medusa?  Neither resemble this creature though.  Jinxia is cowering without the light source that we left in the room we escaped from.  Needs a candle to see, but such may draw attention.  Jaxxen hatches a plan to use the boots to sneak up on it to see whats happening. Runs to where it was and sees it facing the wall, perfectly still.  Thinks its facing the mirror. Looking at it, it seems to be the same greyish color as the statues. It may be turned to stone. Matheris suggests throwing bearings at the creature to see if it moves. Jaxxen takes some bearings, and acts like hes throwing them, but doesnt. Matheris notices the deception, and blurts out "If you didn't want to do it, just tell me", takes a handful of bearings and throws them at once.  The creature doesn't move. We head back to the cavern.  

Theres a nest in the soil of ground with 3 giant blue eggs and black spots on it. May be from the creature. They are sizeable, about 2 feet in diameter. Matheris takes an egg, puts in his pack, and destroys the others while Jaxxen looks on with concern.  He says "You know, it usually takes two to produce, so there may be another of those beasts around here".  We move through the cavern with pathways on either side and identify a main path leading upwards.  We traverse a cliff and see a light ray beam through but theres much earth and rock and roots around.  Jaxxen ties a rope to something sturdy and throws it to Matheris as something to hold on to to help ascent. We begin digging intensely at the dirt with daggers.  It's slow work as we dont have proper shovels or pickaxes.  Time passes, and we hear the creature moving and growling. We continue digging furiously and the creature gets to the bottom of the cliff below us. Its clawing at the wall trying to jump but can't reach us.  Matheris looks down towards it. Feels the gaze and is startled, knocking some rocks lose which causes the effect to stop.  We get Jinxia through the hole, and hand her the rope to tie to a tree. and beging digging towards us from the top side. Eventually the hole is enlarged enough that we are able to pull ourselves through back to the surface.

We look around and dont see the horse or mule. We see the road heading to the city. Matheris blows his whisle attempting to attact the mule, but doesnt hear anything. We see mule prints were leading to the road. We attempt to track but cant catch a scent or suitable markings. Decide to continue on road to find a safe place to camp and rest for the night.  We make camp and Jaxxen takes first watch. Sees a fire up the road on the side about half a mile or so.  Keeps a watch on it and mentions it to Matheris when its his turn to watch.

## Day 5

When we wake in the morning we eat rations and discuss plans.  We didn't see anything else from the site up ahead but will check it out on the way to the city.  We approach teh fire site, and Jaxxen recalls that the mule had a notch in its horseshoe and there's a footprint in the ground here resembling the same.  Suggests we may be able to catch up to them if we move at a faster pace. Through the day we move as quickly as we can, but are hampered in part by Jinxia's slower speed. We eventually see a man walking with a horse and mule and close in.  Matheris hails the guy. Says it seems he's saved his equine and hes grateful they've been recovered.  The man states back "Are you talking about my horse and mule I purchased 6 hours ago?"  He claims to have purchased them from an orc and paid 175 gold for them. Matheris mentions that will read on his epitaph.  The man now tries to get moving and pulls the mule along. He gets on the horse. The mule bucks away to the side. Jaxxen fires a shot at long range at disadvantage, but manages to hit him square in his head! The man falls off the horse. The group catches up and Jaxxen holds the bridle of the horse and attempts to calm him. Then says "You look like a Dusty". Matheris is glad to have his mule back. The group continues to the great city.
