# Session 1 - Seeking the Tower of Umar

20230619 - 20230620
- Matheris / Halfelf Bard 1
- Jinxia / Halfling Rogue 1
- Jaxxen Nage / Tiefling Warlock 1

## Day 1

Jaxxen the warlock and Matheris the bard gather some additional supplies before setting out from Frizgate towards the great city of Nostr. En route they recall legends of a stone tower that used to be present on a side route. While slightly out of the way, Jaxxen and Matheris agree to see if they can locate it and check it out.  Its supposed to be into the woods 150-200 feet from the road, where there are three noticeable weathered stones on the side, with one darker then the others.  The name is the Tower of Uram.  It could be unsafe, but there could be riches as there was a well off person of nobility there. Matheris has with him Jinxia, a small halfling that hides in the pack of a mule named Serafina.  Before leaving, Jinxia successfully steals some rations, and Jaxxen decides to buy some outright.  At the end of the day we rest, each of us taking a watch.  On Jaxxens watch, he holds his wrist periodically and looks to the sky considering the night serpent in his vision.

## Day 2

We each eat rations in the morning. There are no specific events this day. Some wind, big clouds in the sky. Calm and peaceful. Dirt and gravel on the road, and some bigger smaller boulders.  The forest is present on boths sides with tall trees.  We see a horse with saddle, but no rdier. Not connected bridle behind and eating grass. Materis goes to the horse and sees the saddle is bloody. Examining the blood, it seems to be either elf or half-elf blood, about a day old.  Jaxxen suggests we press on, and walks the mule Serafina with Matheris on the horse. We make camp and Jaxxen takes the second watch. Rubs his wrist, and Matheris notices it.  Jaxxen thought he saw something above the clouds for just a moment, but then it was gone.

## Day 3

We eat rations in the morning and the clouds over head are the same, big and puffy. We remember about the three stones we need to be looking for. Soon, arrows fly towards us from up the road. Matheris has cover behind the horse but tries to take cover behind rocks on the left side and stumbles. Serafina the mule ends up taking an arrow to the abdomen while moving to the left side of the road and is wounded.  Jaxxen quickly drops behind a rock on the right side.  We hear noises in the distance, and think we're about 180 feet away.  Matheris tries to be clever, using mage hand to carry a stick towards the noise, but doesnt attract any fire. But we see a hooded figure with a longbow and leather armor taking aim. As we dash from rock to rock, archer draws again and we see another draw a bow.  Not sure how many, could be 2? 3?. Jinxia thinks its a half-orc but shrugs uncertain. Matheris decides to hop back on the road and plee that we mean no harm. Ends up being hit with an arrow in response.  At this point Jaxxen knows this was no accidental strike, and immediately fires his crossbow toward the figure, hitting him.  Matheris then gets behind a boulder. We notice a third figure come out of the woods. Matheris hits and does damage with Jinxia cheering him on. Jinxia attempts but misses and ducks. One of the orcs was on his back. Jinxia hits it. The orc shouts at Matheris and hits him.  Saw some shuffling movement behind the boulder where they are.  Jaxxen hit the orc and then runs for the boulder. Matheris moves towards the orcs and Jinxia readies for another shot.  One of the half-orcs disengages and makes a break for the woods.  We see the remaining half orce bloodied mouth and badly injured. Jaxxen demands his told and he says its on his side. Jaxxen reaches for it, but notices the orc grabbing his dagger. Jaxxen quickly fires a crossbow bolt but misses. Jaxxen is hit by the dagger for a small damage. Matheris rushes in with longsword, but stumbles and misses. Jinxia saves us hitting for enough damage to kill this dastardly being.  Jaxxen takes the pouch, sees the coin inside, grabs 3 gold and hands them to Matheris. Matheris in turn hands some to Jinxia.  Jaxxen decides to try to pursue the one that got away while Matheris rounds up the horse and mule.  Jaxxen follows the blood trail but after a while loses the trail and decides to return to Matheris.  Matheris is having a bit of difficulty rounding up the beasts. Jaxxen catches up to Serafina and succeeds at calming her and removing the arrow from her side. She's heavily wounded and still bleeding. Jaxxen has nothing to stop the bleeding. Its getting dark. Matheris fully heals Jaxxen.  We see the three stones on the ground and decide we should make camp around here. The stones are exactly is it was told it would be.

## Day 4

We eat rations and were fully healed over night.  Matheris heals the mule Serafina.  We investigate and look at rocks in the field. Jinxia notices more in a distance in the forest. Most are stone from the tower on the ground. Buried in the earth somewhat from years of weathering. Centuries.  We see a stagnant puddle of water about 30x40 foot that is green on one side, sick swampy like, and a tree off to the distance.  Looking close at the stones under bushes we see a wooden doors of some type.  Jaxxen thinks the door may be trapped. Jinxia takes a closer look and sees a trap line to a spikey log overhead.  Not sure how to disarm it, Jaxxen concocts a plan to trigger it. We all step clear of the trap and Jaxxen throws his spear at the door. It hits solid and causes the trap to trigger. A big limb with spikes swooshes down crashing with heavy force into the tree and stops. Its clear that if we were there, we'd be dead.  Matheris throws a rock at the door. Nothing else happens.  The spear is destroyed.  Jinxia doesnt see any more traps.  The door is a double oak door with a keyhole. It's about 4x6 foor and into side old stone same as the tower. Offset about 70 to 80 feet and at an angle.  Jaxxen decides to try to just open the door. Its unlocked! It opens with ease.  Holding the door open, he welcomes the party to step inside.  Within its dark. And steep. Too step for the horse and mule. We quickly tie them up outside to the tree, and venture within.  The air is moist wet air kind of mildewy. It's not evil, but offseting. Inside its dark. Jinxia is a halfling and can't see. We are guiding with Matheris in front, Jaxxen middle and Jinxia to the rear. Jaxxen pulls out pen and parchment and works on trying to draw a map of their progress down the slope. We get down a ways and nothing happens. There's an entry to a room ahead 40 feet down. Jaxxen tries throwing some sand to see if it triggers anything. Nothing happens. Matheris attempts with a single ball bearing. It bounces into the room and must have hit a wall as it comes back towards the steps.  We go into the room, about 25 ft. See several bedrolls, some furniture. Food and drink look like someone was recently here. Jaxxen checks the corner for any feces or droppings and finds none. Just mildewy. Jaxxen convinced its nothing like goblins or other wretched creatures, but could be worse if its like cultists.  When entering the room, another wooden door was noticed. Vertical ahead. 2-3 people had to have put a boulder in front of the door to try to keep something in.  We see hooded robes from the half-orc with blood on it. Its then that we notice the blood trail splatter that had gone up the stairs. Matheris checks it over and suggests its about 6 hours to a day old. Very recent. Jaxxen convinced this is the orc that fled into the forest the previous day.

**_Technical Intermission_**

With the big tree limb and boulder against the door, we scour the rest of the room. We don't find much of anything apart from a silver piece with Jaxxen promptly pockeets. There's no papers or potions, nor do we find any traps. The room is about 10 feet high, and 30x30 in dimensions. And we had come down about 40 foot of steps.  Looking at big log/tree stump blocking the door we decide to try to push it out of the way.  The boulder proves a bit more challenging, taking all of our might several times and using bits of furniture to slowly move it enough out of the way that we could open the door. Before doing so, Jaxxen does a Thaumaturgy cantrip to cause tremors in the ground and the party listens for any movement on the other side. We hear nothing. We move the boulder the rest of the way and Jinxia tries looking through the keyhole of this wooden door with iron hinges. She also sees nothing and notices no traps, but indicates the door is unlocked. Jaxxen pulls the cloth from under the door and all at once the smell of decaying matter wafts in, quite the bad odor. Slowly opening the door, Jaxxen motions for Matheris and Jinxia to enter. The floor and side of wall has a cave in. Think its from green murky pool from up on the surface. On ride side of wall there is a hallway that continues. Jaxxen updates his map.  

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/e/ea/Monster_manual_1e_-_Carrion_crawler_-_p13.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200715095535" align="right" width="120" />Taken off guard, Matheris is hit by a tentacle that reaches down from above with pointy jags. They didnt inject any fluids but hurt Matheris badly. Then a mandible like head overhead. This beast is large, about 5 feet wide and 15 feet long, like a centipede of some sort Jaxxen notices whats going on and fires his light crossbow at the mandible part. Jinxia jumps up off the shoulders of Matheris to get reach and pierces the creature with a rapier. Matheris swings with a longsword. Throughout the battle damage is taken on both sides and at one point Jinxia is hit, and goes limp. Jaxxen is near death and makes a desperate attempt to grab Jinxia and pull her back into the room we came from. With success, Jaxxen and Jinxia is out of reach of the cenitipede while Matheris battles on and hits it good.  With each hit the centipede screeches in pain. Jaxxen fires a shot through the door, but misses the monstrosity. With a final blow, Matheris hits it again and the creature begins falling from the ceiling. Matheris promptly ducks out of the way!

</details>
Hearing the ruckus of the cenitpedes demise, Jaxxen shouts "Go ahead and loot this one, I'll get the next", and tries to tend to Jinxia but has no potions to offer. Matheris looks over the organic matter of stomach matter and sees tunnel from the right wall, brown boots in the muck and a decaying hand among other waste.  He checks out the boots seeing they are finely made, perhaps elven and in good shape.  He notices something else shiny. There could have been a handful of victims in here over time. Matheris finds a finely crafted dagger and a stainless steel canister and takes them both.

The party takes a short rest in the room outside the muck. As a result, Jaxxen is mostly healed, and the poison affecting Jinxia starts to wear off naturally. We consider strategies and potentially returning up the stairs going to town and hiring a mercenary to help us.  Soon after we hear a noise up the steps. Something is on top of the door we came in. There's voices but Jaxxen can't quite make it out. We investigate and think the log trap was reset and triggerd on top of the door as the light is blocked and we cant move it.  We hear the mule and horse going off in the distance and think they've been stolen. Matheris is panicing about his pack animals and we try to think of ways out. With the door weighted we cant budge it. It would take too long to burn it with fire, and we'd suffocate in the process. 

Matheris does some herbalism on Jinxia healing her more and tells Jaxxen and Jinxia about the boots. Jaxxen takes a look and says that they are boots of elvenkind! The wearer makes no sound from steps and it gives advantage on dexterity checks.  Jinxia equips the boots.  We check back downstairs at the tunnel and hallway. Tunnel has bodies rotted over time and redigested. ugh. Comes out the right side where stone gave way. Hallway on the other side is of proper stone built with the right side caved in. We see that it opens up into another room. 

This room is 30 by 30 feet, but noticeably taller then others, about 13 feet tall.  Jaxxen uses his steel mirror to look around entry through room and sees door to the right and across the way, along with some furnishings. Its a stone room thats very old. We go in the room. Jaxxen looks at the door across the way and sees that it is orante markings with the word "URAM" script. The other door in the room also has markings, but in a language that nobody her understands.  There's also some fancy lantern hooks on the wall, and Jaxxen suggests that these lanterns are more useful for seeing than the candle that Jinxia has been carrying around. He grabs one and hands it to Jinxia, and then pours some oil from a flask in it. Jinxia lights it with her candle and the room is lit up bright.

The furniture here is very ornate. Like curio cabinets and such. Jaxxen investigates them. Most are empty, just dust for the most part but on the upper shelf of one, Jaxxen finds a ring. It seems to have magical markings in nature but Jaxxen can't make it out and decides to pocket it.  Matheris notices and asks about it. Jaxxen hands the ring over and says .. "Do you want to try it on?". Matheris hesitates and hands it back. The ring is gold in color, has markings, but none of us know what it does.  We'll check it out when we get to the city.  There's also a large mirror in this room about 7 feet tall and 4 feet wide, unbroken, and apart from some dust coating its in perfect condition, affixed to the wall. Jaxxen taps it with his dagger and it holds up.  Looking at the door marked "UMAR", find it locked. Jinxia works on it and manages to unlock it and didn't detect any traps.  Jaxxen pulls the door open. Looking through the door its all manner of busted stones and rubble from the ruins of the tower blocking access. Its completely impassable.  Jaxxen states "Guess we're not going that way" and motions to the other door.  We ask Jinxia to take a look to see if its trapped. She says there's no traps and she unlocks it as well.  Jaxxen tells people to clear to the side from the door and he attempts to open it with haste. 

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/8/8f/Basilisk1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190616192630" align="right" width="120" />Its then that there is a sound on the other side of the door. Sounds like walking. heavy steps and growls of huge gutteral voice coming toward us.  Jaxxen suggests a quick plan. If we put the lantern in the center of the room the whole room will be lit well and Jinxia will have her hands free in case we need to fight. And then we can get on the wall on the side of the door to limit visibility of whatevers coming to us.  The beast gets to the door. Only some of us are able to hide.  It looks in to the left and right but doesnt see us on the sides. Matheris casts prestidigation to make a smell ahead in the room to distract the beast. Its this large big headed thing with scales and horns and spike tail.  The smell succesfully draws the beast further in, and we take the opportunity to quickly get in behind the beast. Matheris and Jaxxen make it, but Jinxia touches her foot on the beasts tail.  The creature turns quickly, and now its tail is in the room.  We high tail it up this corridor to the next area planning to hide. We get to a cavernous area with stalagtites and stalagmites. Looking around we see statues of people in pain on the ground in contorted shapes and some appear to have bites in them.  Jaxxen thinks they were living people turned to stone while running away from something attacking them.  Now there is silence. The creature isn't moving.  Matheris thinks back to the enocunter and remembers a creature that could turn stuff to stone. Jaxxen suggests it could be a minotaur? or a medusa?  Neither resemble this creature though.  Jinxia is cowering without the light source that we left in the room we escaped from.  Needs a candle to see, but such may draw attention.  Jaxxen hatches a plan to use the boots to sneak up on it to see whats happening. Runs to where it was and sees it facing the wall, perfectly still.  Thinks its facing the mirror. Looking at it, it seems to be the same greyish color as the statues. It may be turned to stone. Matheris suggests throwing bearings at the creature to see if it moves. Jaxxen takes some bearings, and acts like hes throwing them, but doesnt. Matheris notices the deception, and blurts out "If you didn't want to do it, just tell me", takes a handful of bearings and throws them at once.  The creature doesn't move. We head back to the cavern.  

Theres a nest in the soil of ground with 3 giant blue eggs and black spots on it. May be from the creature. They are sizeable, about 2 feet in diameter. Matheris takes an egg, puts in his pack, and destroys the others while Jaxxen looks on with concern.  He says "You know, it usually takes two to produce, so there may be another of those beasts around here".  We move through the cavern with pathways on either side and identify a main path leading upwards.  We traverse a cliff and see a light ray beam through but theres much earth and rock and roots around.  Jaxxen ties a rope to something sturdy and throws it to Matheris as something to hold on to to help ascent. We begin digging intensely at the dirt with daggers.  It's slow work as we dont have proper shovels or pickaxes.  Time passes, and we hear the creature moving and growling. We continue digging furiously and the creature gets to the bottom of the cliff below us. Its clawing at the wall trying to jump but can't reach us.  Matheris looks down towards it. Feels the gaze and is startled, knocking some rocks lose which causes the effect to stop.  We get Jinxia through the hole, and hand her the rope to tie to a tree. and beging digging towards us from the top side. Eventually the hole is enlarged enough that we are able to pull ourselves through back to the surface.

We look around and dont see the horse or mule. We see the road heading to the city. Matheris blows his whisle attempting to attact the mule, but doesnt hear anything. We see mule prints were leading to the road. We attempt to track but cant catch a scent or suitable markings. Decide to continue on road to find a safe place to camp and rest for the night.  We make camp and Jaxxen takes first watch. Sees a fire up the road on the side about half a mile or so.  Keeps a watch on it and mentions it to Matheris when its his turn to watch.

## Day 5

When we wake in the morning we eat rations and discuss plans.  We didn't see anything else from the site up ahead but will check it out on the way to the city.  We approach teh fire site, and Jaxxen recalls that the mule had a notch in its horseshoe and there's a footprint in the ground here resembling the same.  Suggests we may be able to catch up to them if we move at a faster pace. Through the day we move as quickly as we can, but are hampered in part by Jinxia's slower speed. We eventually see a man walking with a horse and mule and close in.  Matheris hails the guy. Says it seems he's saved his equine and hes grateful they've been recovered.  The man states back "Are you talking about my horse and mule I purchased 6 hours ago?"  He claims to have purchased them from an orc and paid 175 gold for them. Matheris mentions that will read on his epitaph.  The man now tries to get moving and pulls the mule along. He gets on the horse. The mule bucks away to the side. Jaxxen fires a shot at long range at disadvantage, but manages to hit him square in his head! The man falls off the horse. The group catches up and Jaxxen holds the bridle of the horse and attempts to calm him. Then says "You look like a Dusty". Matheris is glad to have his mule back. The group continues to the great city.

## Day 6

Matheris, Jinxia, and Jaxxen are continuing on the road headed to the largest city in the realm known as Nostr. 

Ume and Ulysses are on this lesser traveled road with a large forest on both sides. They had previously met and had setup camp nd are breaking down.  On approach, Jaxxen and his group assess that these two individuals are not a threat. 

We introduce ourselves and have discussion as we continue on the road together. We ask if Ume and Ulysses have seen any orcs.  They haven't.  Ulysses doesn't remember his past and is devoted to martial arts and defending himself. Looks to try to help the downtrodden and those whom are bullied and attacked as he was. Ulysses was taken in by an order of monks who let him choose his own name. We're about 3 days from the city.

Eventually we get to evening and decide to find a place to make camp. On a hill on the right side of the road a clearing is identified that may be good. We setup and the monk stretches. Matheris plays a flute. Jaxxen looks to the clear skies.  On either side of the road, large trees are very wide. Jaxxen and Ulysses gather some dead wood and talk for a bit of history. Ume helps ensure the wood they collect is dead, and not live. Jinxia opts to blend into a nearby small boulder to sleep. The group settles in for the night with fire crackling and hear sounds in the woods.  Matheris takes the first watch, then Jaxxen, and Ume. Ulysses is sleeping already and will go last. Matheris watch is without incident, as is Jaxxen's. On Umes watch, its about 2-3 am. Jaxxen goes into deep sleep and dreams of a bright green light anbd black serpent. Its shocking, rocking him to his core in and after some time, Jaxxen is awoken sitting up in a jolt, sweating intensely and grips his forearm. Jaxxen looks at his wrist, and for just a second thought he saw the serpent ove.  Jaxxen describes some of his background to Ume and goes back to sleep. Later, at 3 am, something wakes the whole group.. the sound of a man screaming, the worst kind of pain, blood curdling screem, deep in the woods. We all wake from it. Ulysses utters a phrase in halfling "a shadow is a trusted friend".  Matheris, Jinxia and Ulyssees will go to check out the scream.  Jaxxen and Ume stay with Dusty and Serafina at the camp. Before setting out, Jaxxen returns the boots of elvenkind to Matheris.

_Subgroup: Matheris, Ulysses and Jinxia_

Matheris, Ulysses and Jinxia head into the woods with a lantern for light. The woods get thicker. Can hear the dying sound of a man again. Matheris notices nothing special. They close half the distance. They try to actively hide and put the lantern out. Crickets starting up again with light out. Ulysses and Jinxia dont have good vision and Ulysses is holding onto Matheris' cloak They hear something on the ground, kind of heavy pounding, something of weight like bags of sand. Matheris sheaths his sword and readies his sling. Ulysses with quarterstaff in hand, they see a light on the ground up ahead. Jinxia gets some white sticky substance on her hand. They notice its on all the trees, sticky and whispy. Matheris thinks it could be some kind of spider. Ulysses suggests they ask the druid back at camp. The sound may have been someone falling prey to it.  The group hears a moan in the direction of the light and see humanoid sized humps on the ground with white sticky covering on all the trees. The light source is a torch on the ground. That area of the humps is kind of a clearing. The group proceeds to try to get closer for visibility. They hear stuff moving around in 2 different directions. Humanoids are encased in the sticky substance. Camp fire smoked out, and a tent thrown into one of the bushes. Matheris looks into the trees but doesn't see anything.  Ulysses listening and hears something from above. Can't pinpoint it and Jinxia also doesnt see. The party communicates intentions to return. And then an arachnid comes down making chittery ihsect noise, and attacks Matheris and Ulysses, landing on both of them. Multiple hairy legs trying to grab and bite. Missis with the bites but has held down. Senses that there is more than one.

_Party members regrouped_

Jinxia attempts to cut away webbing on Matheris. Ulysses shouts "Is anybody there?! Can you hear me?!" and hears a faint moan. He then looks and finds around a tree someone with chainmail armor laying against the tree and has some webbing on him with a wooden shield to the side.  He's hunched over in bad shape and barely alive. Think he was stung. He looks in trees. The moon flickers just right and he sees the two other spiders, about 40 feet away in the trees. Sees 3 more spiders, 5 total and lots of webs.  He shouts "There's 5 more spiders up in the trees!"

Jinxia wants someone to help Matheris. Jaxxen goes in, grabs Matheris and says "IF we're getting out of here, lets go" and begins moving back the way he came. The man in the chain mail makes out some words "Help... help.."  Ume rushes to him, picks him up and retreats. Ulysses and Jinxia follows promptly behind. Jaxxen is leading, with Ume in the back. We hear some noises behind us. 

Ume makes a bonfire cantrip **behind** the group in the forest. Jaxxen continues heading toward camp but is encumbered and moving slower. We get to camp, and the fire behind us went out.  The man and Matheris are propped up at the camp. Ume has an herbalism kit but doesnt have necessary components.  Ulysses takes a water pouch, pouring some in Matheris mouth. Jaxxen asks if any flowers or anything in the area could potentially help. Ume says theres a bark of a kind of tree in this area that can help. He describes the kind of tree to look for.  Ume, Ulysses and Jaxxen go to look for the tree. We relight Matheris lantern to see. Dont find anything yet. 

Jinxia remains with Matheris and the man. She searches the mans possessions looking for any coin. Finds 5gp, 2 empty scabbards, a pack on his back has rope and a torch. She also finds a small pick, and a little glass vial that has no labeling and is a shade of orange.

Ulysses and Jaxxen continue looking for the tree bark and Ulysses thinks he's found it. Ume goes over and collects some bark on a dagger that Jaxxen provides. He can use it as an antidoe. We head back to the camp to try to heal Matheris and the man. Pours some inside Matheris mouth and the other guy as well. There's no effect yet on either.

The party attempts a long rest and Jaxxen stays awake. Jinxia hears something approach and thinks its spiders. Up in the canopy, on the ground, there are 50 to 60 spiders approaching. Jaxxen wnats to get on the horse and head out. He takes the man and puts him on the horse. Ume gets Matheris on the mule. We head out as fast as we can. Get to the road at an angle. Behind us we see dozens of spiders at the edge of the forest bobbing up and down looking to us. We make note of the spider area on a rough drawn map, noting Arachnid Forest.  

We continue onwards and after some time, Matheris and the old man come to.  Ulysses asks him who he is. He replies "Herist".  Matheris is conscious but weak. Not too cognizant yet.  Evening time comes and we look for a place to rest. Find a clearing on the hill on opposite side of the road.  The order of watch is Jaxxen, Ume, and Jinxia. Jinxia asks if we know what the vial of liquid is or the stainless steal cylinder from the ruins.  Jaxxen says he's never seen a potion like that cylinder.  We setup camp. Moon getting full. People are healing. We get through the night.

## Day 7

When we wake in the morning we eat rations and discuss plans. We see a covered wagon coming down the road with a man on the front and a horse leading it and lanterns on both sides.  Jinxia wants to check it out. Ume asks if we should offer security or hitch a ride? Jaxxen asks if we should steal the wagon?  .. Matheris approaches the wagon and tries negotiating for a healing potion. Introduces himself and the rider is an old man named Otto. Otto claims to have business in the city of Nostr and doesnt have room in the wagon for people, nor has he any potions. Jinxia stealthily checks out whats in the wagon. She gets to the back and can slip inside, sees 4 chests with big locks on them. She may be noticed attempting to get inside. Matheris continues bantering to distract Otto and asks if he could share his travels. Ulysses himself had written a poem and asks Otto if he'd like to hear it.

```
   We heard a noice and became the hiders
   Not for long though there were spiders
   I stuck my head in the spiders dead
   Seen 50 more thouh and so we fled
```

Otto givs Ulysses a nod of his head. But then notices Jinxia and asks her to get out of his things.  Jinxia threatens Otto and says "Maybe you should get out of here".

Jaxxen and Ume are up on the hill at camp looking down. Ume notices a group of 6 humanoids in columns side by side with big pikes in the air and points it out.  They are up ahead and approaching the covered wagon from the direction of the city. Jaxxen suggest swe go down to the rest of the group. The man on the mule, and Jaxxen on horse. Old man on wagon notices 6 soldiers coming and says we may have trouble coming.  Matheris asks if they are hostile. Old man closes eyes, puts hand to side, opens eyes and says "These are unfriendlies. This will not be good. Not the usual soldiers you might think". Ume suggests attaching the horse to teh carriage to increase speed to go faster. Otto says it wont with additional weight.  Hereist the fighter gets off the mule.  Jaxxen suggests moving aside to allow the soldiers past without trouble. Otto says they will attack, and hes not going around. Jaxxen asks what kind of business he does and Otto says he's a simple salesman.

We hear commotion, as the soldiers have spotted us. They break formation and are running towards us with pikes in downward positions. We hear snarls and growls. Jinxia gon. Jaxxen fires his crossbow bolt and misses. Ume attempts to wrestle control of the the wagon from the old man.  Ulysses, Matheris and Jinxia prepare to get in the wagon. Jaxxen steadies on the side of the wagon and fires at the soldiers. A crossbow bolt bounces off platemail of one of the soldiers. Hereist asks for a weapon and Matheris hands a longsword to him. Ulysses hiding in the wagon along with Jinxia. Jaxxen stays on his horse. Ulysses is tethering Serafina to the back of the wagon.  Ume cracks the regns to get horse moving as fast as possible, then drops hs reigns to cast an entangle spell. The soldiers are coaught up in the vines and are using their short swords to try to free themselves.  We see creatures about 6 to 7 feet tall, well built, grotesque, with big cannines in their mouth, nasty looking and strong platemail armor.  Jaxxen coordinates with Ume for a plan and throws an oil flask in the entaglement while passing. The flask breaks spreading oil. Ume casts a bonfire cantrip and the oil intensifies its flames around the beasts.  Ulysses throws a dart but misses. We pass and the spell is broken. They've turned and are coming towards us. Some are trying to put the fire out on them. They are really angry now and running to us.  Jaxxen fires a crossbow bolt but misses. He then says "Throw stuff at them! Anyhthing!"  Jinxia throws the rest of the ball bearings out on the ground behind us causing two of them to fall on the bearings.  Otto begins casting a spell. Three powerful bolts shoot from his fingertips with golden power. One hits the ground but two of the beasts are squarely hit knocking them down. The two remaining beasts slow up to render aid to their fallen and we successfully get away.

An hour or so later, the horses are getting tired and we are slowed down. We ask Otto if he's familiar with the area and he warns about spiders. Jaxxen suggests he may be able to identify some things. Otto says that up at the crossroads there is an inn and buildings before the main busy road into the city.  This area of the road is much better. We'll get there a little after dark. Jinxia asks Otto if he knows anything about the vials of liquid. With his long skinny white fingers he asks "may i see those?" and Jinxia hands them over. He takes the vials, one with red liquid, one with the stainless steel. The flask he says "oh it must be something good, but I dont know. This one in the red is a potion of strength".  Matheris asks how he knew and Otto says he's seen it before says the red with silver lining and is certain its a potion of strength.  Otto wans to hear a song tonight at the inn and Matheris says he may be able to.  Otto then declares that he needs to take a big shit when he gets to the inn.

**The Inn**

It's after dark and the old man insists we go further as the inn is not too far. We see lights of a few buildings and more traffic. We arrive to the inn which is named the Happy Fairy. We see horses tied on the outside and a half-elf standing by a horse. There are some stables around the side. 

_Ulysses heads into the inn to sleep and logs off._

Otto goes to the stable, pays a gold piece to stable his horse.  Jaxxen does the same, paying 1gp/night to stable his horse and get him well fed.  There's no noticeable guards but plenty of people around.  Jinxia pays attention to the money exchange at the stables, looks where they put the coin.  Main caretaker puts in upper pocket and has a short sword on his side. We hear the sound of people at the inn.

Jaxxen quickly scopes out the exterior of the building for stairs, windows, sees curtains drawn and finds 2 doors off the back. One he hears nothing and the other the sounds of a kitchen.  Relays findings to the group. Matheris gathes his flasks to refill inside. Ume goes to the man that was rescued and pats him on the back to get him into the inn. Matheris retrieves his sword from him. The old man thanks Ume for helping him. Says his friends are all deceased and thanks us for coming to his aid. Matheris says for him to spend a night in the tavern and offers drinks to the old man. We open doors of the inn, smell spicey potatoes, meat, delicious smells. It really hits us, then we see someone in the corner playing a stringed instrument. Not singing much, just playing. Two waitresses service food and drinks, dressed for serving, and a large man with white apron on doing cooking. Matheris heads straight for the bar.  Theres a handful of people there and he sets up at bar on a stool.  Jinxia takes a quiet corner to observe. 

Jaxxen wants a room, talks to waitress who refers him to someone in the inn named Myrtle.  Upon finding her he pays 1gp for a room for hte night and heads to room #5. His plan is to try to scale the exterior and listen in on any conversation in the rooms.  

Ume wants to join Matheris and other man at the bar but theres no room and he sits at a table with others instead.  A story of the encounters is relayed to people at the table. Ume asks if they've seen creatures in plate armor. The others at the table haven't. They are headed to Nostr themselves but didn't see any creatures.

Matheris hails the bartender or a waitress when available. An elf comes over cleaning a glass. Asks how he can help. Matheris has some questions and asks whats it cost for a drink and food. The elf indicates the price and mentions the spicey potatoes, soup and chicken, beef, all kinds of food. Matheris orders a plate of chicken and spicey potatoes, slides 2gp over and points towards the fighter and says .. until it runs out, keep their tankards full and i'll take one for the road. Asks if he knows anyone specializing in curing poison.  The half-elf motions towards a a gentleman in the back corner and says his name is Timar.  Matheris approaches Timar who wears a black hooded robe and has a mustache.  Asks him about poisons and healing. The man says that this place could use some better entertainment. They negotiate a bit and Matheris hands him his potion of strength for a cure and promises to entertain if cured. Also points to the man in chainmail. The deal is struck and the man tests the potion putting a bone at the top of the liquid in the vial verifying it.  Matheris hands a vial to the fighter and consumers the other. Both are freed of the poison and restored to 100% health. 

Jaxxen's room has a single bed, made for a traveler with a table and chair. There is a window in the room. He locks the door, checks the room, and then leaves most of his items taking only what he needs for the outside. He opens the window and starts scaling around using his pitons and climbing kit.  The first window he gets to he can open it, but doesnt understand the conversation, as its foreign to him. The next is openable and lit and the third window wont open. Jaxxen returns to the second window to take a closer look and sees a half-elf female at a small table brushing her hair. There's a mirror reflecting back andhe also notices a rapier next to the table. Jaxxen traverses back reversing steps to his room and goes down to the bar to grab a drink and relay findings to the group, particularly Jinxia if they can hatch a plan.

Ume the druid grabs a drink and prefers to hang outside. Its evening and a number of people are walking about doing things, tending to horses, pack etc, checking down the road.  Something catches his eye. He notices a chair on the edge side of the inn, next to the road.  Ume thinks about the old man, the powerful wizard and doesnt know where he went.  Ume goes to the stables, talks to stablehand. Found out instigators of the past have found a deathly demise. Ume notes there's no guards and asks how its defended. The stablehand says there is some protection but wont relay how. Ume relays info to the others before heading to another table to try to gather info on what happened before.  Herist the man in the chainmail tells his story and what he could remember of the spiders. They share their travels, some had run-ins with goblins about a week ago. Come through small hill from another town and were attacked by 7 goblins, killed most, but one ran off.  Ume notes the stables and rooms are so expensive but there's no guards in sight. Person says we saw how they protect this place. The second story building above teh stables has people with heavy crossbows standing watch. Says the guy in the corner that got the healing from are swindlers and thieves. Puts up glass of ale and they toast.

Matheris makes his way to individual playing stringed instrument. That person is half-lef looks up and introduces himself. They agree to have Matheris take over for a bit to sing of his tales while the other takes his lute and goes to get a drink. Matheris plays an uplifting song before laying down his hat, making use of prestidigation for showers of sparks enticing people to give him coins. As it gets more entertaining, the closed conversations in the room get more lively. Some tapping their toes and some watching Matheris.

Jinxia notices a really big guy and axe with studded armor and shield leaning against a table. Hes eating a lot of food and may have a big coin purse on his right belt.  The guy focused mainly on his meal, drinking a lot of ale in big gulps.

Jaxxen and Jinxia discuss the half-elf upstairs and rapier considering options to potentially acquire it, but then think about the risks and may try to do some pickpocketing outside instead.  The big burly guy with his ale belches, somewhat causing a scene with his inebriations. Jaxxen mentions to Jinxia that if we wait here long enough, that guy could be an easy mark. Jinxia is worried that the big man could hurt them.  They notice the group in the corner also playing close attention to the big guy.  A plan is decided to try to trip one of the guys when they approach the man as a distraction so Jinxia can attempt to steal teh purse under the table.  They sit down at a closer table with a dwarf nearby.  Jaxxen tells their story of the tower of umar and draws out a copy of the map from memory based on that one previously made and makes note of some interesting stonework the dwarf may want to check out.  Sells the map for 5sp and notes info about the trap at the entrance, carrion crawler and basilisk.  Jinxia then notices a robed figure talking to the big man sitting down, trying to ask a question. The man is inebreiated. Another hooded figure behind him bending over to touch his boot. Jinxia elbows Jaxxen to indicate whats going on. Jaxxed bumps the hooded figure bending over into the big guy.  While this is going on, Jinxia sucecssfully gets under the table, cuts the purse and quickly gets out. She then grabs onto Jaxxen and pleads not to start a fight with this guy. Jaxxen agrees and returns to the table with the dwarf.  The Dwarf being curious of what happened. Jaxxen says he was just interested in the boots the guy is wearing, says they looks like boots of elvenkind and he just wanted a closer look.  The dwarf in his inebreiated state, briefly mentions a mine, but then wont talk any more about it.  Jinxia sneaks up to Matheris, slips the coins in, and then goes to a room for the night. Pays and gets room #2.  Jaxxen takes leave and heads to his room #5.

Matheris purchases a room for himself. He earned a gold piece from the inn owner, 19 silver, 27 copper and spends a gold on a room getting room #1. Jinxina heads to his room, retrieves the coin purse, and splits the take with Jaxxen (26gp,2pp,1sp each). 

Jaxxen looks out towards the stables to see if he can verify the existance of watchment with crossbows. Doesnt seem them, but does see a catwalk overhead which would be a good place for someone to attack.  Asleep, Jaxxen is woken by a knock at the door. He prepares his dagger and goes next to the door but doesnt answer. He hears some instruments working the lock.  He promptly opens the door, and kicks at the person pushing him back. Then hits another assailant with his dagger, and green-flames the second on the ground with fire damage.  The first person is up and hits Jaxxen with his own dagger. The battle proceeds and quickly Jaxxen kills them.  He checks the hallway, sees the lights are out, and closes the door with the bodies inside.  He quickly checks over the bodies finding coin, a scroll, thieves tools and kit and one wearing a fancy necklace.  He leaves the lesser coin, and takes 13 of the 14gp and 5 daggers.  A woman is heard asking why the lights are out.  Jaxxen then yells from within his room "Thief! Thief! -- DIE!". The lady calls for some guards and 2 heavily armed big guys come down with crossbows. Jaxxen says these thieves broke into his room while he was asleep and he killed them in self defense. The guards check over the bodies, note the condition and asks how they attacked. Jaxxen hands over 3 of the daggers they had and claims that he took the weapons from them after the fight.  The guards take the bodies away and another comes along introducing Corum.  Jaxxen insists that he shouldnt have to pay for the room if its not well protected and was harmed. The man gives him a potion which Jaxxen drinks and heals some. The guy ends up paying him 2gp to Jaxxen for his troubles.  Jaxxen thanks hiim and goes back to sleep.

__Jaxxen, Jinxia, and Matheris level up__


# Session 3 - Entering Nostr

- Matheris / Halfelf Bard 2
- Jinxia / Halfling Rogue 2
- Jaxxen Nage / Tiefling Warlock 2

## Day 8

Jaxxen wakes in the morning, leaves some things in his room and heads down for food.  He sees the clientele has switched out, but still quite bustling with activity.  There are several tables open and after Jaxxen chooses one to sit at, he orders some eggs and grits.  Asks about Ostrich eggs, but they dont have any of those. They do have large eggs though.  The waitress comes over to take a drink order and Jaxxen has his waterskin refilled. He tips the waitress 3 silver and still somewhat alarmed from last night, asks if anyone here seems out of the ordinary.  The waitress indicates that all seems normal, nothing out of the ordinary.

He sees Matheris wonder down the stairs, his hair all a mess. Jinxia with him, ready to go.  A waitress helps Matheris to his breakfast needs and he asks for half a chicken, an ale, and a coffee. Jinxia wants whatever he doesnt eat of the chicken.  Foods on the house. Matheris flips her a silver piece.

Jaxxen describes the incident last night, and shows the paper that fell out of a scroll to Jinxia and Matheris. Jinxia thinks the G means guild. But doesnt recognize the names of them.  Knows it was written by and for a thief to read. Look at the scroll. It's magical, has some runes on it. I know its magic.  Matheris could examine the scroll to identify it but doesnt have the material components.

Jaxxen explains what happened with the dwarf and selling a copy of the map made of the ruins of Umar Tower.

Ume comes down and says hes gotta go. Has to check on something in the woods and mentions that Ulysses had something he had to check out and would meet at Nostr.  

Matheris goes to the baths and gets clean.

Jaxxen telephatically communicates to Jinxia suggesting to make a copy of room keys for when we return. Jinxia will try to sketch the keys for rooms 2, and 5. 

Matheris comes out from bathing.

Jaxxen returns to his room, gathers supplies, but makes an indention of his room key in the sealing wax.

Regroups and checks out. Returns keys to the waitress.

we walk out. 3 wagons (2 with grain, 1 with potatoes) loaded headed to nostr. 2 empties coming out.  we didnt' notice Otto's wagon.

We head to the stables. a few people in the courtyard. up above we do see guys with heavy crossbows. down below one of the stablehands comes out, asking if ready for mounts.

Matheris enquires about the elder man with the wagon, turns out he left a few hours ago.  Serafina ok as well as chest.

We see another guy with heavy crossbow and short sword talking to manager.

Jaxxen enquires about his horse, and feed for the road.  For food for the road, its 4 silver for a day. Jaxxen gives him 5 and accepts the feed and puts in his pack.

We head to the general store.  We see Hereist coming in our direction. His head down and sad. Matheris greets him. Slept outside, it was fine. He joins us on and Jaxxen provides him 2 daggers.  At the store we see some folks outside with horses. We go in and its heavily stocked. About 5-6 workers constantly working restocking. Looks like some local security as well, with heavy crossbows and shortswords, strategically positioned.

Matheris asks Hereist if he specializes in any weapons. He prefers a long or short sword. Hes best with a long sword and shield to cause attacking creature to have disadvantage when friendly is near him.  Matheris enquires about identifying magic items, but the shopkeep isn't able.

Asks about swords and shield. Shopkeep pulls out a longsword. Hereist looks it over and says its a fine sword.  And pulls a wooden shield as well.  Through negotiation, we get the price on a wooden shield and short sword down to 31gp, with Jaxxen paying 14gp and Jinxia and Matheris the rest.  Matheris swaps his long sword for the short sword that they acquired for Herist who now has a long sword, shield and 2 daggers.

Matheris asks the shopkeep about the thieves guilds in Nostr. He doesnt have specific knowledge just knows theres multiple guilds. Indicates there's a tax to get into Nostr.  If have a cargo of food they don't charge you. But otherwise, individuals pay 6 sp to get into Nostr.

Jaxxen says it sounds like the thieves guild starts at the entrance to the city!

Shopkeep says the City is booming, so much trade, with ships coming and going. When the king imposed the entry tax, there were people upset about it.

Matheris asks if he may know a way in or out of the city avoiding toll roads.  Shopkeep hesitant, but describes a spot 1000 yards south of the gate where there's spaces in between the walls that could be used. Green bush growing out of side of wall. could slip in. If caught by guards could be jailed.

while heading back to stables, Jaxxen describes to Jinxia his ability to disguise self and change appearance, that they could use to appear as one of the guards and allow Jinxia to shop.  The group doesnt take any immediate action on it, but considers for the future.

A half-elf turns down an offer someone is trying to sell a horse for 90gp. Half-elf offers 60gp. Jaxxen offers 64gp. Half-elf trying for a deal. The other now says he wants 75gp. Wants a room and a bath and something to eat.  Half-elf doesnt have anything super fancy and is turning to head into the inn. The guy selling the horse accepts 66 gold for the horse. He puts under his clothes and he goes quickly into the inn. Ive always called him Thunder, but you can call him whatever you want. Jaxxen hands the horse over to Hereist.  Matheris asks that Hereist join him in the ballad of the generosity of Sir Jaxxen when they reach the Drunken Goblin Tavern.  

Matheris gets Serafina. Jaxxen gets Dusty. Jinxia crawls into the chest on Serafina, and we head out.

We pass a number of people heading the other way. Peaceful journey. We're impressed by how large Nostr appears as we get closer. Blonde elf, fair skinned headed to Nostr, has a religious symbol around her neck, praying. She looks to sky, and with left hand praying hard. Another person traveling with her.

We see a large battlement facility up ahead. Walls of Nostr arent completely solid. Its walls on outside with exceptions here and there. We see houses outside city and blacksmiths working outside the city and farmers fields. 

Jaxxen suggests he could make the appearance of a cart using silent image, it'd only be visual, and would be discovered with physical inspection.  Jinxia volunteers to check how the process is during wagons entering to see how closely its scrutinized. By the time she gets up there, sees 15 guards at the gates, stopping wagons, doing a little search on each. Those without commercial goods there's coin exchange.  Jinxia reveals the dilema.  Most wagons were single people with cargo. One or two wagons had cargos with multiple people. Each had to pay a coin.  The fortress had over 60 guards at that area practicing different military activities.

We see a man outside who has bundles of wheat near him and strike a deal to buy some bundles of wheat from him to load on our horses. And he verifies the bush and a large bush tree, behind it is an opening about 8 feet wide. Lot of people use that to get in.  Matheris asks his name. It's Norton.  There's patrols in the city. Two houses and an alley beyond the bush. After that it gets to street. Probably no guards there, most of the time.

We find the bush and the opening is wider than others. More ideal for passage that we need.  Jaxxen checks the area for magic. Bush had brown nuts that glowed a little. Jaxxen doesn't know anything about deez nuts.  We enter the alleyway between houses. It opens up and we see more houses.  Gets more congested. Opens to small streets. Look around for commerce, but its just people that live here washing clothes. Poor people.  Jaxxen suggests we could sell the wheat at cost. They offer 4 copper. Jaxxen says that seems fair. Matheris agrees to sell it cheaply. Kids and adults come running out for the cheap food.

Busy street with lots of people. Activity everywhere. Candlemaker at the candle shop. People talk about the market ahead and got a good deal on some fruit... Next street deeper into city. Wide street, open air market. Stands as far as your eye can see into the market. No idea how many there are in the city, but this is one.  We see some large vendors that have people help them with their wares. Seems like locals. Nothing spectacular, but has every common thing you can think of. Its about 2pm. Matheris hails them and asks if knows of a safe affordable inn or someone that can identify magic.  Shopkeep knows of tower of High Sorcery.  Purchased 4 oil flasks, and Jinxia bought 10.  Next stall has some footwear.. then clothes, and then on to archer.  Jaxxen buys 20 crossbow bolts.

We get to a locksmith and Matheris inquires about a lock for his storage box, and the shopkeep here shows him one for 15gp but it only has one key. Its a poisonous lock. Jinxia pops out and asks if he can make another lock and he refers the group to someone nearby that can make keys for 7sp.  She pays for the lock. The guy shows her how to set and unset the lock with the poison. She heads to the guy that can make keys and buys a key copy to this lock. And then also asks if able to replicate a key from a drawing. She pays 2gp to have 3 keys made from the drawings.

Regroup and we head to Owl street to find the stables passing other vendors. Owl street on the right, its quieter, not as busy as market street.
