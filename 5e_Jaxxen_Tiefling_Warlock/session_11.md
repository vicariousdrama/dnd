_The group is on the 3rd floor of the Dunken Goblin Tavern_

Ulysses wakes up. He goes to the mirror in the closet, touches it and goes through it. He sees the rest of the group at a table. He realizes he knows new stuff. He's able to spin his staff quicker and can even catch missled from ranged attacks in mid air.

## The Drunken Goblin and Otto

Edwin at the Drunken Goblin is talking to Otto and another elf friend. Its about 3-4 AM. Matheris sits down with Otto and shows him a spellbook he found. Otto studies it and is in deep thought. Jaxxen is drinking an ale and looking around at the clientele. Edwin sees Ulysses has slept off the drunkeness and brings him over to the table. 

Ulysses sees the elf lady from his dreams. Its the first time Otto got to the third floor. He looks at Matheris and says this is a very good book and asks if he would part with it. Matheris tells gives freinds and family price. Otto Offers a bard intrument instead. A Mac Fu'Citern. It includes some spells including Fog Cloud.  Jaxxen asks about Malachi. Otto says he spends some time in the tower of High Sorcery, came back with items and dissapeared. Was quite a riot coming to the Goblin, have known him before as they met at the Alechemist shop near the tower buying components for spells. The tower is a 2-3 day walk from here, southewest. He's been to 4 or 5 of the libraries in the city including the grand library which is also near the tower of high sorcery.

Ulysses thanks Otto for getting out of spider forest and Otto reminds him that they met after that incident when there were beastly armored things on the road with pikes. Ulysses gets up to get a drink at the bar.

Edwin appreciated by Otto and wants to get rings identified and investigate the paintings. Otto looks at the rings and dagger. Wants 100 gold, which Edwin doesnt have. But Jaxxen slides some across the table and Matheris also kicks in 10 gold pieces for a third item to be identified. One is a Ring of Swimming. There is also a Ring of Water Breathing, and a Linguist Ring. These latter two must both be attuned to function properly. Matheris wants the Linguist ring, and Otto does too.  Says its worth about 1000 gold pieces, and Matheris offers 1500 gold. Edwin accepts.  Matheris pulls out 30 pounds worth of coin and gives it to Edwin to pour into his backpack.

Ulysses returns with a tray of drinks for the table. Otto says he is staying at the Inn nearby and leaving tomorrow. He calls over a young human and gives him instructions to go get the Citern. He heads out. Otto points to an elf named "Umbrel" who may be able to identify Edwins dagger. Wants 50 gold for identity and Edwin pays up. Its a fine dagger. A +2 dagger. Edwin holds on it to it.

Ulysses goes back to bartender and asks for strongest drink he has and Bartender pours a small amount. Ulysses doesnt want to drink and instead wants the whole bottle. Bartender charges 50gp for the bottle. Ulysses pays and checks a sample to ensure he can light it with a flint. He drinks and is buzzed from it. Its good stuff. He doesnt need to fancy box it came in, and puts it in his satchel.

Ingrin is praying. Hereist is drinking and looking around. Jinxia checking out the high rollers. The young human returns back to Otto and hands him the item requested. Otto provides the instrument to Matheris. It is wondrous item. Matheris accepts the exchange for the spellbook.  Jaxxen asks about hte Alchemist shop location and Otto says its near the tower of high sorcery.  The Owner is named Rae, shes a elf Alchemist on Wendy Street. Near the grand library.

Jinxia looks up at the Umbrel dude and asks if can identify items and he says he can for 50gp each. She pulls out the amulet and necklaces with rubies on them and slaps down 100gp.  He tells her that if they aren't magical he will still need to take the funds since he's expending spell slots. She doesnt care. He casts a spell on the amulet and it is not magical but could get a few hundred gold for it. And the necklace is also not magical but may be worth more.

Jaxxen asks Jinxia if they have any maker marks on them. Jinxia checks, and they do. Both are from Pankratz Jewelers. Jaxxen recalls thats the place that Bren was working for.

Matheris pays to get a sword and mace identified. Edwin sells the +2 dagger to Jaxxen for 700 gold.  The group gathers their things and prepares to depart. Jaxxen leads them down the secret way down from 3rd floor. Sees someone of significance in a purple robe with short hair. And a guard motion to the group to follow. We exit out of an alleyway. We go out the closed building with velvet curtains. 

## Pankratz

We then head on Merchants Way towards Pankratz. Its early morning and the shops aren't yet open.

It seems to be a fine looking establishment. There are bars on the window, and then we notice a gnome on a bench on the porch. A female crying. Matheris sits on the bench next to her asking if ok and it startles her.

She says her friends are missing. Matheris rambles about being in a guild and this scares her. She doesnt want anything to do with guilds or to talk. Matheris fails to persuade her and she goes running off screaming.

The hours of the jewelry store indicate it opens at 9AM. Its still early. Other shops nearby like Renegade Butcher also open at 9. There's even a Yolo shop, but boarded up. On the Yolo building there is a wanted poster with the picture of an elf.

We head down the street and Matheris gets a short sword looked at at the weapon shop. Owner knows the maker and its about a days ride away. He offers 25 gold for the sword and Matheris accepts.  The name of the owner of the shop is Nade.

## The Stables

As the day gets started Bardhome Boulevard begins filling up with people. We get to the stables wanting to pay for more time to stable the mounts. As we approach, there is some guards there checking things over. The stablemaster was hurt as is Nathair.  There was some kind of incident last night. Says that thieves took some stuff. Nathair is in stable condition.  We ask how the mounts are and find the animals to be ok. Matheris does healing word and Ingrin heals Nathair. The mounts there are startled still, and their saddles are missing.  The room where Nathair and the chest were at is open and the chest is not there. We find out that there were 3 or 4 people that were cloaked and it happened before dawn. Two short people and two tall ones. One of the small ones could be the leader, said "Lets get ouf here Kalara". Ulysses gives Nathair some of the good booze he got. Matheris tries tracking but theres been so much foot traffic that its no use. Cant tell where anyone went.  The stablemaster says he can't protect our animals now and wnats us to go. But Matheris pleeds with him and wants to keep watching for a week. Edwin has been ritual casting a spell speak with animals all this time and calls down his young hawk. Asks if he witness what happened here. Says it was night time. He then asks the mounts. Serafina says there were 4 humanoids. 2 short and 2 tall. Ran down Light street, and heard the name "Kalara".  

Matheris departs and heads on light street back toward the south toward blacksmith hoping to find his chest. He goes to the taylor and asks them if they saw anything but they haven';t. He pays them and wans them to send a message to him if they hear anything. Can reach him at the Night Owl Tavern. He leaves 5 copper. He goes past the temple and looks around and ses a guy who was out smooking. Asks him and he didnt see anything either.  It seems the city was peaceful until Matheris showed up.

Edwin has an idea of trying to communicate in rogueish language. Jinxia says she can but nobody else can. She sees marks of the "Prowlers", "Grimfellows" and the 3 nails. They are marking different areas. But none giving indication of last nights incident.

We see the government buildings up ahead and beginning to open. Jaxxen suggests there may be a register of sorts inside where we could look up the name Kalara to see if it has an associated business or address. A guy out front says citizen registration is voluntary, may want to check with the city guard.

## Picking a Fight

Matheris goes up to guards and goes on and on rambling about his chest and the guards are good for nothing, dont protect anything etc. And eventually they've had enough and they try to tackle him. He tries to escape and fails. Then tries to shocking grasp and that hits for 1 damage. Jinxia takes her rapier and tries to stab a guard that wasn't shocked. She misses and tries a second attack with the short sword and drops it.  The guard takes out his long sword and goes for Jinxia hitting for 6 damage and again on a second attack for 4.  Matheris casts Firebolt at the one standing, hitting for 5 fire damage. Then ducks under a wagon. Two more guards approach.

Ulysses sees this and promptly tries hiring 2 prostitutes to walk up and distract the approaching guards.  Jaxxen uses Message to tel a guard "Quick, theres a probem on Bardhome Boulevard, Head tehre now!" He stops but is confused. 

The guard with sword out for Matheris. With swords out, others surround Jinxia, tell her "Drop the weapon, or die". She slowly puts down the rapier and puts her hands up. 2 guards grab her and one holds a dagger to her throat while they are hauling her to jail.

Matheris tries to Firebolt a guard but misses. Guard misses his two shots. A second guard hits for 8. From Elminster road to Light Street, see another guard coming. Matheris hits for  7 shocking damage. Matheris runs into the Owl Bear Tavern. Patrons are pointing him out to the guard.  Matheris ducks behind the bar. He firebolts toward the liquor cabinet. It misses but lights the ceiling on fire. Barkeep runs away. Fire above the bar and guards on both ends to get to him. They are trying to block the exits. Matheris uses Fire bolt again, misses and lights a table on fire. Guard hits him for 7 and another hits for 5 knocking Matheris unconscious. Ulysses rushes in to try to headbutt one of the guards and misses. Performs an unarmed fury of blows for 5 and second unarmed strike misses.  

Jaxxen followed in back alleys and is across the street from the Owl Bear looking to see if Matheris or Ulysses come out. He doesnt want to get involved, but will aid in their escape if they make it out.  Hereist and Ingrin following the action not causing a conflict with the guards either.

Back in the Owl Bear Tavern, Ulysses takes the alcohol bottle and tries to throw in direction of the guards. It gets on stuff and ligths up. The whole place is gonna burtn down. He keeps battling but misses with his staff. Hits unarmed for 3 and misses with other before jumping over bar. Guard swings over teh bar and misses. Ulysses attacks with staff and hits for 7 and unarmed attack breaking the gaurds ankle.  I think Ulysses killed one of the guards. More guards rushing in and they see half elf and fellow guards. One guard is on fire and one was pulled out. One has hand on monk Ulysses wants to ask him questions. Townspople coming with buckets of water to try to put the fire out.

Jinxia was brought to jail, but would resist if ever given the chance and is screaming as much as possible.  They take all her equipment from her to examine it at the counter. Edwin is seeing all this and he decides to turn into a rat and follow her into the jail.  The guards hang the keys to the cell on teh wall. 

Guards from from the barracks to Owl Bear to interrogate Ulysses. They ask what happend and they are picking up Matheris.  He makes up a story convincing that there was a madman casting spells and he doesnt know him and was just trying to be a hero or something. Some guards help their comrade to get healing at nearby church while others haul Matheris body to the jail cell.  At this point, Matheris has passed one death save but also failed one.

Jaxxen in back alleys still and watches where they take Matheris. Matheris now at 2 death fails.  They put Matheris body in the cell with Jinxia. Jinxia continues screaming at the guards to try to be intolerable.  There are three guards in the jail and Edwin is st ill in rat form hiding. The cell is fully visible to the guards. Edwin untransforms in front of the cell and casts cure wounds on Matheris healing him for 6. Guards demand him to drop his weapons now. Edwin holds up his arms. They want him to throw his weapons and everything to the door. He complies.

Matheris takes the opportunity to cast Ice Knife on one of the guards. It hits and explodes. Guard fails save checks and takes more cold damage. Some guards die and there are two guards left. THey run behind the counter and get their long bows and take cover. Jinxia rolls behind Matheris for cover. Edwin casts Create Bonfire on the guards behind the counter. Guards fail to get away and burn a bit. They move and drop their bows and pull swords out. 

Ingrin sees Ulysses hurting and uses Lay on Hands on him to heal for 7. Nathair with her. Jaxxen suggests can make someone invisible to sneak into the jail to see about Matheris and Jinxia, unaware that Edwin is in there.  Ulysses decides he needs a break and heads to Seimi's tavern

**(Player for Ulysses logs out)**

The group outside discusses plan. Will make someone invisible and they wear boots of elvinkind for more silence. Group at Fizer cemetary sees guards rush out of jail. Jaxxen casts invisibility on Sonia the Ranger and sends message as she enters. Hereist and Dragonborn are together across the street. Ranger heads into jail and sees Matheris Jinxia and Edwin in a cell. Sees the fire by the desk and key in middle of Bonfire hanging from wall. She tries to get the key with her crowbar and does so without taking damage. The key is hot so she slips into a bucket of mop water nearby. It steams a little. Jinxia and Edwin see the key drop into the water. Range goes to the cell and tries to unlock it.

Outside, group sees guards approaching the jail. Jaxxen sends a message "We need more help at the Owl Bear Tavern"to the guard. This leaves a guard confused about where it came from. One guard runs to the Owl Bear. Another stays around the jail. Hereist sees the guards. 

Jinxia heals for 8 from a potion. Door to cell has opened.

Jaxxen approachs guard and guard says to get back. All back up and he steps backwards towards stables across the street.

Matheris casts healing word and then wants to let others out of cell. He heals Jinxia for 7.  Edwin grabs his gear and steps out of the cell. He asks "Who's there? Show your self. Speak". The ranger speaks and says she is Sonia.

Jaxxen sees 9 guards from Light Street coming.

Back in the Jail, Jinxia looks and finds her pack was burned in the bonfire. Jaxxen sneaks into the jail as a half elf. Jaxxen looks at the group, says, "You've got to grab your shit now, we got to go". Matheris casts healing words again on Jinxia.  

Jaxxen grabs the bucket of mop water and when exiting the jail throws it and uses shape water to freeze it. Its not very effective, making a small ice patch.  Guards point at Jaxxen. He quickly goes around the corner with the group. Sonia makes it to an alley unseen. Jaxxen messages Matheris to hide the group and meet back at the stables before dark. He grabs the dress from his pack, throws it on, and changes his appearance to that of a female half elf and heads the opposite direction on Merchant Way toward Pankratz.  Edwin casts create bonfire on a pile of firewood. Jaxxen attracts further attention screaming at the fire. Blows a signal whistle waves hands in the air and continues running in the direction of the Drunken Goblin.

The rest of the part is out of the alley and they head through to Fizer Cemetary to try to open the gate.  Jinxia has two daggers and a rapier on her. Sonia uses thieves tools with proficiency to unlock the gate. They take the chain off the gate enter and close behind relocking the lock. They get to the mosoleum and see the gravestones turned over. Edwin sees scratches on the door. Lot of them. Not sure what caused it.  The mosoleum is locked. Matheris has the keys and will unlock the Mosoleum.  Gujards are heard on Dagger Boulevard shouting. They lock the mosoleum and all behind.

Jaxxen gets to the crowbar and decides to have a quick meal. Talks to the staff about how its such a peaceful town.

The other group heads into the lair under the mosoleum. Edwins hawk is with him.

Jaxxen checks the stable master at stables and mounts. Sees Serafina and other mounts are there. Goes to the general store and buys 10 oil flasks.  Then heads to temple and to see about healing potions.

Meanwhile, Edwin takes a short rest and Sonia wants to stay back. Matheris and Jinxia want to head back up top to the stables. Jinxia is considering going back to the Jail to try to recover more of her stuff. Guards got full fire out at the Jail and firewood place. Guards are all around the jail area.  Hereist is with Matheris and Sonia wants to stays in base. Hereist asks Sonia if she can loan her tools so they can unlock the gates and she joins. Its about half an hour before it seems safe for them to exit the cemetary without being spotted. While Sonia fails to pick the lock, she lends her tools to Jinxia who succeeds. They dont lock the cemetary back up, instead putting chain over the lock to give appearance to a casual observer that its chained shut. 

The sun is starting to go down. The group moves through alley ways and see movement above of carpenter shop. Jinxia informs the group and Hereist pulls his longbow. The shadows are gone and Hereist puts it away.They go around the corner to the stables.

Jaxxen at the temple asks about potions and they have 3 available for 50 gold each. Jaxxen pulls out 160 gold pieces and thanks them. In appreciation, they say he can buy another. So he gets 4 total before returning to the stables.

When Jaxxen sees Jinxia he says he can give her his thieves tools. Matheris gives her his bag of holding to carry stuff. Jaxxen says he can cast invisibility on Jinxia but its the last spell slot hes got. Will prep and do near/behind the shoe cobbler across from the jail for maximum time.  

Meanwhile, Edwin leaves the lair and at the cemetary, locking up and transforms into a cat shape to get through the wrought iron gate. He heads to jail to try to collect Jinxias stuff to surprise her.

Sonia positions herself on Dagger Boulevard to act as a distraction playing music.  She plays quite well.  

Jinxia sees guards outside and on merchants way and makes her way across unseen. When the door opens, she slips in. She sees 3 guards inside and goes to where her equipment was.  She successfully gets past the three guards and one of them is going through her stuff doing an inventory. He's laying the remaining items out on a a linen cloth to itemize them.  Edwin hops on the guards lap or back to try to distract him.
