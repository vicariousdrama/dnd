_The group is on the 3rd floor of the Dunken Goblin Tavern_

Ulysses wakes up. He goes to the mirror in the closet, touches it and goes through it. He sees the rest of the group at a table. He realizes he knows new stuff. He's able to spin his staff quicker and can even catch missled from ranged attacks in mid air.

## The Drunken Goblin and Otto

Edwin at the Drunken Goblin is talking to Otto and another elf friend. Its about 3-4 AM. Matheris sits down with Otto and shows him a spellbook he found. Otto studies it and is in deep thought. Jaxxen is drinking an ale and looking around at the clientele. Edwin sees Ulysses has slept off the drunkeness and brings him over to the table. 

Ulysses sees the elf lady from his dreams. Its the first time Otto got to the third floor. He looks at Matheris and says this is a very good book and asks if he would part with it. Matheris tells gives freinds and family price. Otto Offers a bard intrument instead. A Mac Fu'Citern. It includes some spells including Fog Cloud.  Jaxxen asks about Malachi. Otto says he spends some time in the tower of High Sorcery, came back with items and dissapeared. Was quite a riot coming to the Goblin, have known him before as they met at the Alechemist shop near the tower buying components for spells. The tower is a 2-3 day walk from here, southewest. He's been to 4 or 5 of the libraries in the city including the grand library which is also near the tower of high sorcery.

Ulysses thanks Otto for getting out of spider forest and Otto reminds him that they met after that incident when there were beastly armored things on the road with pikes. Ulysses gets up to get a drink at the bar.

Edwin appreciated by Otto and wants to get rings identified and investigate the paintings. Otto looks at the rings and dagger. Wants 100 gold, which Edwin doesnt have. But Jaxxen slides some across the table and Matheris also kicks in 10 gold pieces for a third item to be identified. One is a Ring of Swimming. There is also a Ring of Water Breathing, and a Linguist Ring. These latter two must both be attuned to function properly. Matheris wants the Linguist ring, and Otto does too.  Says its worth about 1000 gold pieces, and Matheris offers 1500 gold. Edwin accepts.  Matheris pulls out 30 pounds worth of coin and gives it to Edwin to pour into his backpack.

Ulysses returns with a tray of drinks for the table. Otto says he is staying at the Inn nearby and leaving tomorrow. He calls over a young human and gives him instructions to go get the Citern. He heads out. Otto points to an elf named "Umbrel" who may be able to identify Edwins dagger. Wants 50 gold for identity and Edwin pays up. Its a fine dagger. A +2 dagger. Edwin holds on it to it.

Ulysses goes back to bartender and asks for strongest drink he has and Bartender pours a small amount. Ulysses doesnt want to drink and instead wants the whole bottle. Bartender charges 50gp for the bottle. Ulysses pays and checks a sample to ensure he can light it with a flint. He drinks and is buzzed from it. Its good stuff. He doesnt need to fancy box it came in, and puts it in his satchel.

Ingrin is praying. Hereist is drinking and looking around. Jinxia checking out the high rollers. The young human returns back to Otto and hands him the item requested. Otto provides the instrument to Matheris. It is wondrous item. Matheris accepts the exchange for the spellbook.  Jaxxen asks about hte Alchemist shop location and Otto says its near the tower of high sorcery.  The Owner is named Rae, shes a elf Alchemist on Wendy Street. Near the grand library.

Jinxia looks up at the Umbrel dude and asks if can identify items and he says he can for 50gp each. She pulls out the amulet and necklaces with rubies on them and slaps down 100gp.  He tells her that if they aren't magical he will still need to take the funds since he's expending spell slots. She doesnt care. He casts a spell on the amulet and it is not magical but could get a few hundred gold for it. And the necklace is also not magical but may be worth more.

Jaxxen asks Jinxia if they have any maker marks on them. Jinxia checks, and they do. Both are from Pankratz Jewelers. Jaxxen recalls thats the place that Bren was working for.

Matheris pays to get a sword and mace identified. Edwin sells the +2 dagger to Jaxxen for 700 gold.  The group gathers their things and prepares to depart. Jaxxen leads them down the secret way down from 3rd floor. Sees someone of significance in a purple robe with short hair. And a guard motion to the group to follow. We exit out of an alleyway. We go out the closed building with velvet curtains. 

## Pankratz

We then head on Merchants Way towards Pankratz. Its early morning and the shops aren't yet open.

It seems to be a fine looking establishment. There are bars on the window, and then we notice a gnome on a bench on the porch. A female crying. Matheris sits on the bench next to her asking if ok and it startles her.

She says her friends are missing. Matheris rambles about being in a guild and this scares her. She doesnt want anything to do with guilds or to talk. Matheris fails to persuade her and she goes running off screaming.

The hours of the jewelry store indicate it opens at 9AM. Its still early. Other shops nearby like Renegade Butcher also open at 9. There's even a Yolo shop, but boarded up. On the Yolo building there is a wanted poster with the picture of an elf.

We head down the street and Matheris gets a short sword looked at at the weapon shop. Owner knows the maker and its about a days ride away. He offers 25 gold for the sword and Matheris accepts.  The name of the owner of the shop is Nade.

## The Stables

As the day gets started Bardhome Boulevard begins filling up with people. We get to the stables to pay for more time to stable the mounts.
