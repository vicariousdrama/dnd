_The group is recovering after a battle with a small black dragon_

Hereist and Cobalt lost their magical shields. Garth's robes are trashed and he's out of spells. In the room where the dragon was its like an Underground cavern with rain from abve. There is lots of mud, junk and debris along with decomposing bodies and pitted bones.

## Watch During an Attempted Rest

Jinxia takes the first watch for a rest, then Siona and finally Jaxxen.  Cobalt will watch as well and Hereist used a flask in a lantern.

During Jaxxens watch, bells ring to the north west. He heads towards that direction and messages Cobalt and Hereist that we may have action at the other door.  We go to cover at the edge of the tunnel and see humanoid lizard type creatures coming from the northwest. A few looking at the slain beast that is in the middle, and one looks in our direction.  Lizards go to an earthen mound. There's about 7 of them.

Hereist and Cobalt pull their longbow and longswords out to prepare. Lizard thing is moving closer to the beast studying it. He dashes towards the beast for cover.  He notices us and throws a javelin at Jaxxen but misses. Hereist dashes towards the others. The lizard casts entangle, but Jaxxen evades the vines. Cobalt gets tangled through and spends his time busting himself free before beginning to head after Hereist.  A lizard throws a javelin at Hereist but misses.  Jaxxen casts sleep on the lizards and then moves toward the group in the east tunnel.

A lizard hits Jaxxen with a javelin, while another misses Cobalt. Hereist hits a lizard for 11. A magic casting lizard creates a Hyenna that attacks Cobalt for 12.  Cobalt returns the attack hitting with both his swords and the hyenna falls dead.  A lizard throws a Javelin and misses Cobalt.  Jaxxen uses mold earth to form piles behind as he heads down the corridor. He hears draconic from the creatures. They are running towards the group.

Hereist yells out "We got some company" and wakes Siona, Edwin and Jinxia.
