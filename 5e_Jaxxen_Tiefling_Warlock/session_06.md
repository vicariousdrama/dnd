## Day 11

_main group_

Jaxxen is interested in what he previously learned from the dark elf at the Night Owl about the old building across the street. Supposedly has access to the sewers in the basement with some small boats. And next to that is Zorch, whatever that means.

We met Nathair and Ulysses when they come into the Night Owl Tavern.

_back to Edwin_

Edwin went to Drunkin Goblin Tavern looking for us. He was apparently giving up all kinds of info like our names, what we look like, and even paying off some folks in the process.  Talks of Matheris the bard, a rogue named Jinxia, a tiefling named Jaxxen, Ulysses the halfling monk, and Hereist the fighter. He meets someone at the tavern named Mer when mentioned a mule and horse. Says there are two stables, Malachi Stables and Duck and Cover.  Edwin checks the two locations, describing the party. Malachi Stables doesn't have em.  When Edwin and Mer get to Duck and Cover stables the stablemaster is reluctant to tell Edwin anything as he doesn't recognize him and he doesnt know the code word. Mer leaves and heads back to the Drunken Goblin Tavern and Edwin heads across the street to the Green Dragon Tavern where beautiful music is playing

## The Old Building

_main group_

Jaxxen and Matheris talk about the building across Gray Street that is boarded up. They leave and head through the alley to the backside and see an old man in rags. Matheris gives him some coin and Ulysses tells him he has to turn his life around. Tries to tell him to become a monk and gives him a copper. Jaxxen asks if he knows anything of the building, but hes not forthcoming. Matheris talks about outreach to the poor. With the beggar helped out with some coin he wants to go. A building behind this one is tall and looking up we see a curtain move. There are two metal doors on this old bujilding with a keyhole. Some debris and rubbish and a landing on the second floor. Ulysses climbs up debris to reach the second floor. He sees another landing further up. THe windows are all boarded up. Ulysses yells down asking if anyone can pick locks. Nathair the Dragonborn tries using a crowbar on the door to open but its bending. Jinxia and Jaxxen are climbing up. Jinxia tries picking the door but fails. Nathair trying more with the crowbard, bedning part of door and not really budging. He runs at the door to no effect. Jinxia tries lock picking door on the second floor landing and fails. Jaxxen goes up higher trying to use his climbers kit. Goes up to the third floor where there are no doors. Just more boarded windows. Matheris knocks on the door at the ground floor, and there is no answer.

_back to Edwin_

Edwin is at the Green Dragon Tavern looking for the group. Owner doesnt recognize anyone he mentions. He has a drink and listens to the music.

_main group_

Jaxxen tries to get to top of building to see if there is a hole, chimney or other roof access. Its tough and hes getting weak.  Matheris tries an oil flask on the hinges and locks of the door. Nathan and Hereist work the door and the door pops open breaking a deadbolt. They open it up to allow people in.

_back to Edwin_

Edwin tries getting on top of roof of Green Dragon Tavern to see more of the city. He gets to a room that has a balcony charming the occupant.  He can't reach the top of the building along, but with the occupant charmed, convinces good use of the furniture to stack up so he can climb up. On the roof he looks down below. Sees someone looking up. Looks around with greater visibility from this vantage point.

_main group_

Matheris pokes his head in the door. Sees a pile of crates floor to ceiling. Jaxxen reminds Hereist that he has a lantern. There are so many crates up to the ceiling filling the room. Hereist and others start pushing crates to the side. A box falls. There are homeless people here crying out wanting to be left alone. Hereist offers rations to the homeless. The homeless are scattering and some go for the food off the dirty floor. Some crawling to a light. Jaxxen changes appearance to look like one of the homeless. Homeless go to an area of the wall that has an opening in it. Pushing garbage out of the way to escape. This is some of the garbage we climbed on outside. Jaxxen follows and as the last one exist says "Where are we going?"  Outside see half go down different alleys.  Jaxxen suggests we could use this bulding as a base as nobody would probably come around. The party discusess barricades. The place smells pretty bad though.

_back to Edwin_

Edwin looks over the rooftop, sees people running from an alley. Sees city guards on horseback.

_main group_

Guards pushing into the building. Demaning people "put their weapons down". Jaxxen says we should go down the stairs. There is also stairs leading up.

<details>
  <summary>initiative rolls</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Jaxxen: 18</li>
    <li>Jinxia: 14</li>
    <li>Hereist: 13</li>
    <li>Matheris: 11</li>
    <li>Nathair: 8</li>
  </ul>
</details>

Jaxxen strikes with his dagger and spins away from them. Jinxia misses and moves towards the stairs. Hereist drops his sword. Nathair tries to swing at the guard on way to stairs and hits. Guards swing for Nathair and hit. More guards enter. One swings for Hereist and misses. Matheris says "Step back or face my wraith of nails" attempting to potray himself as part of Casket Nails group. While very performative, its not convincing. 

Jaxxen fails a Chill Touch attempt but gets to the door. It needs to be opened. Hereist hits a guard. Guards attack and one goes for Matheris. Jinxia goes to see the door. Hereist evades the guards and is running. Matheris slams his fist to the ground casting Thunderwave. Not much damage but does push some guards back. Lots of crates fall.

_back to Edwin_

Edwin hears all the commotion. He sees windows blow out the second floor window and guards go back on horse to get away and get help.

_main group_

Guards are under boxes. Jinxia trying to pick the door lock but fails. Nathair is trying the door with a crowbar and the deadbolt breaks. Which of strong order blows in. He pulls the door open. Jaxxen hands a potion to Hereist who recovers some health.  Matheris drinks a healing potion. Hereist drinks a potion and is back to full health. Nathair rams a crowbar into jam the door. We see the sewer acquaduct below and 2 canoe boats. Jaxxen uses Thaumaturgy to try to cause the door to slam shut. The door is holding with everyone pushing. 

Ulysses is outside the building and saw a guard leave in a hurrgy on Gray Street. He is out in the alley.

_back to Edwin_

Edwin spots Ulysses and climbs down to head to him.  He groups with Ulysses

_Edwin and Ulysses_

Ulysses tells Edwin that there's guards back here and some trouble. See metal door prybarred open and guards shouting and bunch of crates.  Sees the guards trying to open the door to the basement. Edwin casts Create Bonfire on the guards. Several are burned and one died in the event while others are trying to get out of the stairwell of fire.  Edwin runs out of the building towards horses. He mounts a horse and rushes off heading out alley toward Bardhome Boulevard. The three guards give chase out of the building after him, mounting their own horses.

_main group_

Several in the party hear Ulysses outside and guards that were screaming and running off.  They want to save Ulysses.  We pull open the door and see fire and a heavily damaged guard. The Guard hits Nathair. Jaxxen misses with Chill Touch. Jinxia thrusts rapier killing the guard quickly. We see some people outside looking at us. Matheris tries to persuade the commoners to help us and rise up against the corruption of the city.

## The Sewers

_back to Edwin_

Edwin has three guards on his tail. He passes on heading to Drunken Goblin and turns down Dagger Boulevard. Sees a manhole cover. He casts Entangle behind him about 90 feet. covering a 20 foot square. The gaurds on horses get through unscathed.  Edwin tries using his quarterstaff as leverage but its too big for the hole. He tries with his might to lift the cover by hand and succeeds. A guard is close enough to attack but misses on the attempt.  Edwin jumps into the manhole and falls into a sploosh of deep water. The water is moving swiftly.

_main group_

We see Ulysses in the trash outside. He says something as hes kind of passed out and Matheris grabs him. Ulysses tells the group that the druid Edwin was here and hes being chased by guards on horseback.  Matheris wants to try to rescue the druid. Jinxia remains in hiding in the alley looking for guards. When Jinxia gets to the alley she sees guards commotion down Danger Blvd.  Matheris considers going and asks Jaxxen if he may be able to. Jaxxen suggests he could change appearane. Hereist is eager, went ahead and says "come on!" Mathereis talks him back convincing him there are two many guards there and we can go into the sewers to find him and barricade teh door.

_back to Edwin_

Edwin is in stinky water. Sees a light up ahead. Takes hawk out of coat and holds above his head so doesnt drown. He tries to move toward the light on teh right side. Successfully stays swimming and gets to manmade stone jutting out from wall like a staircase of stones on the wall. Goes toward the light.

_main group_

We go back to the old building and down into the basement. Get in the boats and we hear more guards from 1117 Blvd. We throw some caltrops behind the door when we are in the basement to slow them down. Two boats made of wood like canoes are at the bottom.  Matheris, Jinxia and Nathair in one boat, and Hereist, Jaxxen and Ulysses in the other. As we start leaving, we hear the door slamming open with guards swords drawn. Jaxxen starts paddling frantically. We get to a fork leading left and right. We think straight goes under the Crowbar so we paddle left. The water is moving slow here. Hereist has a torch and canoes are heavily loaded. We hear the sounds of swift moving water up ahead.  

_back to Edwin_

Edwin tries to get onto the staircase but failing and clinging there.

_main group_

This sewer portion is leading to an artery in the same direction as Dagger Boulevard. Its picking up speed. Got to prevent the boats from tipping over. Hereist is in front of his boat and sees a light up ahead. He tells us about it and to paddle to the right. We paddle hard to the right to try to get to the light and see Edwin.

_back to Edwin_

Edwin is still struggling to get up. 

_rejoined_

Jaxxen takes rope out of pack and readies to throw it.  Edwin tries again and pulls up onto the steps. Sees the two canoes at high speed. He goes on staircase upwards to the light. Jinxia has a grappling hook. Hereist has one and throws it and it latches on.  Tells Edwin to tie it to something solid quickly. Jinxia throws hers and it hits the stairway but not a good spot. Edwin quickly grabs it and tries to tie it. The canoes are tied and rope comes taught. We're all thrown out of the boats but secured to ropes around us.  The canoes continue down the waterway and disappear.  We all pull on the rope and gradually work our way up over time.  We climb the stairs and see a door with a keyhole.

Jaxxen is concerned about the light here. Its lit, who lit it? Sees its 3 inches wide and is halfway burned down. Something magical and permanent, encased in glass affixed to the wall with metal.  Very quietly we try to open the door. Edwin tries the handle. Its locked. Jinxia looks for traps. Doesn't see any. Attempts to pick the lock and triggers a trap taking some damage.  Edwin helps Jaxxen with Guidance. Jaxxen attempts to pick the lock but fails but there's no more spikes.  Jinxia picks the lock!

Jaxxen calls for room to open the door and pulls on it. Sees a lot fo oil applied to hinges. The inside is dark. We see in the hallway. With teh candle encased in glass its like a small sconce firmly attached to wall. Hereist uses small candle and Jaxxen will cast Thaumaturgy periodically to brighten the area. Three people using candle and it burns twice as quickly with the Thaumaturgy effect.  We go in. Its ground stone an sand on the ground. THe walls are cut stone. A 20 foot hallway. Middle of the hallway has a door and stairs going up. Matheris casts Healing Word on Jinxia.

## A Riddle

Edwin is at the door checking it for traps. Doesnt think it has any. Jinxia sees writing on the door. Matheris sees it is written in undercommon.  He translates what he reads

```
Four keys you need,
From named numbers above,
Forgotten Knowledge you should know
Patterns existed time of old,
Knock all four correctly so you can go.

Fail to match, your life is clutch.
```

We see a rectnagular space that is blank above and below the writing. The ceiling has stone similar to the walls. Matheris translates the puzzle and Jaxxen makes a copy to paper kept in his waterproof case.  At the other door up the top of the steps, Jinxia can't pick this lock. Its super tough. Try over and over multiple people and just can't pick it.

We hear a splash. Matheris checks it and sees a large snake like thing on the stairway. We have crossbows ready and decide to close the door with teh snake outside.  We hear a hiss outside.

Jinxia continues trying the lock on teh door and is really good but the lock resists her

We consider what the meaning of the riddle could be.  1234? 1117 from the street above? Keys related to music? A number system like binary? Matheris casts Identify on the door. Just discovers that it is indeed magical, but doesnt know what spell cast it.  

Matheris will do corner to corner starting with top left and then clockwise.  He knocks 1, and see a number 1 light up in gold like magic.  When he knocks 2, the number goes away.   Wait briefly, and then try knocking 1, then 1, and it stays lit with a second number. He follows that with another 1 knock and then 7 knocks in a row. The answer to the riddle is 1117.  There is some whirring and the door unlocks. It is able to be opened. Its dark. We har a sound like a low dragon or something. Sounds of some beast stepping around.
