## Day ?

_main group_
Jaxxen is interested in what he previously learned from the dark elf at the Night Owl about the old building across the street. Supposedly has access to the sewers in the basement with some small boats. And next to that is Zorch, whatever that means.

We met Nathair and Ume when they come into the Night Owl Tavern.

_back to Edwin_
Edwin went to Drunkin Goblin Tavern looking for us. He was apparently giving up all kinds of info like our names, what we look like, and even paying off some folks in the process.  Talks of Matheris the bard, a rogue named Jinxia, a tiefling named Jaxxen, Ulysses the halfling monk, and Hereist the fighter. He meets someone at the tavern named Mer when mentioned a mule and horse. Says there are two stables, Malachi Stables and Duck and Cover.  Edwin checks the two locations, describing the party. Malachi Stables doesn't have em.  When Edwin and Mer get to Duck and Cover stables the stablemaster is reluctant to tell Edwin anything as he doesn't recognize him and he doesnt know the code word. Mer leaves and heads back to the Drunken Goblin Tavern and Edwin heads across the street to the Green Dragon Tavern where beautiful music is playing

_main group_
Jaxxen and Matheris talk about the building across Gray Street that is boarded up. They leave and head through the alley to the backside and see an old man in rags. Matheris gives him some coin and Ulysses tells him he has to turn his life around. Tries to tell him to become a monk and gives him a copper. Jaxxen asks if he knows anything of the building, but hes not forthcoming. Matheris talks about outreach to the poor. With the beggar helped out with some coin he wants to go. A building behind this one is tall and looking up we see a curtain move. There are two metal doors on this old bujilding with a keyhole. Some debris and rubbish and a landing on the second floor. Ulysses climbs up debris to reach the second floor. He sees another landing further up. THe windows are all boarded up. Ulysses yells down asking if anyone can pick locks. Nathair the Dragonborn tries using a crowbar on the door to open but its bending. Jinxia and Jaxxen are climbing up. Jinxia tries picking the door but fails. Nathair trying more with the crowbard, bedning part of door and not really budging. He runs at the door to no effect. Jinxia tries lock picking door on the second floor landing and fails. Jaxxen goes up higher trying to use his climbers kit. Goes up to the third floor where there are no doors. Just more boarded windows. Matheris knocks on the door at the ground floor, and there is no answer.

_back to Edwin_
Edwin is at the Green Dragon Tavern looking for the group. Owner doesnt recognize anyone he mentions. He has a drink and listens to the music.

_main group_
Jaxxen tries to get to top of building to see if there is a hole, chimney or other roof access. Its tough and hes getting weak.  Matheris tries an oil flask on the hinges and locks of the door. Nathan and Hereist work the door and the door pops open breaking a deadbolt. They open it up to allow people in.

_back to Edwin_
Edwin tries getting on top of roof of Green Dragon Tavern to see more of the city. He gets to a room that has a balcony charming the occupant.  He can't reach the top of the building along, but with the occupant charmed, convinces good use of the furniture to stack up so he can climb up. On the roof he looks down below. Sees someone looking up. Looks around with greater visibility from this vantage point.

_main group_
Matheris pokes his head in the door. Sees a pile of crates floor to ceiling. Jaxxen reminds Hereist that he has a lantern. There are so many crates up to the ceiling filling the room. Hereist and others start pushing crates to the side. A box falls. There are homeless people here crying out wanting to be left alone. Hereist offers rations to the homeless. The homeless are scattering and some go for the food off the dirty floor. Some crawling to a light. Jaxxen changes appearance to look like one of the homeless. Homeless go to an area of the wall that has an opening in it. Pushing garbage out of the way to escape. This is some of the garbage we climbed on outside. Jaxxen follows and as the last one exist says "Where are we going?"  Outside see half go down different alleys.  Jaxxen suggests we could use this bulding as a base as nobody would probably come around. The party discusess barricades. The place smells pretty bad though.

_back to Edwin_
Edwin looks over the rooftop, sees people running from an alley. Sees city guards on horseback.

_main group_
Guards pushing into the building. Demaning people "put their weapons down". Jaxxen says we should go down the stairs. There is also stairs leading up.
