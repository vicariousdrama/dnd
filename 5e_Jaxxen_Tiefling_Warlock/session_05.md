Mans voice, Thoriq from downstairs. Needs to talk to everybody. He says last night a man heavily cloaked came in looking for several people. Put a gold coin on his desk, looking for human in chainmail, two half elves and a halfling. And he said he hadn't seen and couldnt help. He had other ruffians outside in cloaks as well. He'll get us food and recommends we use the back door.

Consider getting Large clothes .. drapes, sheets or rags

Man brings back biscuits and gravy, piture of juice, water.

Matheris asks if the owner knows who the people are. He has his guesses, but doesnt want to say who they may or may not be.

They noticed human in chainmail. Have a cloak for the human in chainmail. Matheris pays for that

Jaxxen will take on appearance of female half-orc.

Nathair is dragonborn
Ulysses is halfling monk
Hereist is human fighter, now wearing cloak over chain mail

Group 1: Jinxia hide under Hereist cloak, + Matheris
Group 2: Jaxxen (as female half-orc), Nathair dragonborn cloaked, Ulysses

will leave out alley

Thoriq comes and tells us we gotta go
will rendevous either at first inn or tavern on gray, or at the intersection of 1117 blvd.

Matheris group goes first
- sees trash cans + workers dealing with trash
- advises people to hang around in trash if needed

Jaxxen, Nathair and Ulysses head down a few minutes later.
Jaxxen will wait until exiting before changing appearance from Halfelf to Halforc

Matheris group sees heavy steel doors, looks for anything else standing out. First building has assorted things in trash. Another has messed up candles, and last at end has lot of broken bottles, held liquor. Matheris does a stretch point it out and waits before crossing light street.
Looks at building to the right of him at light street. tries to discern what it was. possibly fabric or clothing? windows have metal bars on them.  Group crosses light street to back of stables. Sees Grum. Arranges to pay for boarding for another night. Asks about back room with chest. And wants to know if theres a safe place for some people to stay at. Grum is thinking about it, scratching his chin.. doesnt want any trouble. Grum asks what he wants him to do... Matheris asking to rent to them the room where the chest is stored right now for 2 companions to stay. Matheris offers to pay for a week of boarding for the animals and for companions. Grum wants 15gold to do this lodging for a week. Matheris gives him 20gold and also grabs a few things from his storage chest.  Codeword: Banana.  Matheris changes into fine clothing. Asks about the fabric place, and grum lets him know its at tailor shop.  Asks about Gray street for taverns or inns. Grum mentions the Night Owl Tavern. 

In the presence of Ulysses, Jaxxen has some brief amnesia of what the plan was with the liquor store.  But thinks he could check the place and ask around about the recent happenings, the sewers, DGT, and the assassins.
Group heads east in the alley, then south towards Barley Street and will circle around.
Ulysses grabs some wine and two dwarves welcome us.

Jaxxen drags Ulysses to head outside.
we head to opposite corner of light street. Then north on bardhome. The Green Dragon Tavern sits on the end between Gray Street and Light Street. Its more low key.  Next building is Night Owl

_Matheris group_

Matheris and his group go back across light street to the tailor with plans to go in. Hails the shopkeeper. Female half-elf comes up. He asks if they purvey in fine clothing. .. looks at different clothes and cloaks of different colors and hoods. Matheris get a travelers cloak.. black. For fine cloak, purple.  Hereist doesnt need anything. Matheris goes on and buys some hats. They leave and he's headed across bardhome, staying on light street. Sees Green Dragon Tavern, heres subdued music and a bard. The Amory to the south has plate mail and Hereist is all excited about it. Next to that on the south is a Fruit shop and then a general foods and seafood shop.  He looks around for anyone of ill intent. Nothing suspicious immediately stands out. Matheris scopes out the Night Owl. Inside is a number of tables, bar on front and left, with doors fronting Gray and Light street. Center is a walkthrough. Barstools and tables. Patrons from all varieties.  He chooses a table where he can see both doors, with his back to the wall, and Hereist adjacent.

_Jaxxen group_

Jaxxen and group out front of Night Owl. Looks back to DGT but cant make out if anyone on top.  To north of Night Owl old stone building, with doors shut for a long time, windows heavily barred. Glass broken to barred and boarded up, could be abandoned. To the west of it has a name "Zorch". Stone building above the front door, appears to be heavy oak single door, above that sign is smaller then if someone was trying to advertise. Just lettered in red.  Head in the Night Owl. See door on oppositte side with center opened.  See Matheris on other end in a quieter area at a table.  Jaxxen sits down as a separate group.  .. See humans, half-elves, no pure elves, Lot of people in here, some gnomes and halflings.  We see a dark elf at a barstool in the corner that can overlook the bar. We saw a door that says "do not enter" that we think leads to an upstairs.  Jaxxen goes to the bar to get some drinks. Sees the dark elf watching me as well. Orders ales for the table and has one sent to the dark elf as well. Bartender asks for 7sp, and Jaxxen pays 1gp and tells him to keep the difference. Bartender points out who paid for it.  there's 4 "do not enter" doors. nobody coming or going.

_Matheris group_

Matheris orders food and drink from a waitress. Some chicken wings and ales... Matheris notices the dark elf in the corner keeping an eye on Jaxxen and his party.  Also a halfling has a brown robe, hooded but down. He's watching everything as well.

_Jaxxen group_

Jaxxen calls over waitress.. asks for some appetizers and asks about any entertainment. Orders some onion rings, asks about entertainment. asks about the dark elf. she doesnt know him. Dark elf gets up and he taps a guy a few seats away. He comes over to the table and asks to sit. THe other man is human with a black beard, long straight hair. studded armor. short sword, long bow and quiver. Dark elf in all black, with cloak and hood but hood not up. they take a seat. He introduces himself as Garth.  He just got here a week ago. Mostly underground. Jaxxen talks about the Ruins of Umar. Kobalt is the name of his companion, and Jaxxen introduces himself as Kilroc and weaves a tale of the underdark. Jaxxen tries to sell a map for 3gp. The dark elf recognizes him as a tiefling and asks why he's shielding himself. Jaxxen says the same reason you wear that hooded cloak. Jaxxen successfully sells the map, and the dark elf asks who we are.. Jaxxen provides some cover. Eventually says that he heres theres some underworld parts of the city as well.  Kobalt was looking around himself. says last night was at the Drunken Goblin but its a crazy place. Never seen a tavern of that size and that many people.. Jaxxen claims hes never been and is here for the quiet pleasures of the city.

_Matheris group_

Matheris gets up, stretches a bit, heads to bar, asks for a restroom. He slips back a ways towards it, getting better view of halfling. when he comes back, the halfling looking at Hereist. Seems hes wondering something about the table. Halforc comes out of bathroom, pushing Matheris aside. Halforc sits at table with othre half orcs. Hereist doesnt do anything but keeps an eye on it. Matheris looking to half orc and halfling. Halfling may be fiddling with something under table. halforcs loud and obnoxious. People at other tables moving away as they are causing a bit of a scene already. Halfling moved closer to table with Jaxxen

_Jaxxen group_

Jaxxen asks Kobalt how he and Garth met. They were on the road and ran into some Orcs. Jaxxen alludes to Nostr being a safe city. Garth says that areas of the city can be dark. And theres some powerful people here above and below. For 100 gold I'll give you a tip.  Jaxxen says thats a lot of gold. garth says you may want to explore under the city. Jaxxen interested in so much in the city itself, asks how he comes to know of so much. Jaxxen tries for 60gp but he insists on 100gp. Convinces Nathair and Ulysses to give 20gp each. We hand the money under the table.  Garth tells us about the sewers around here, they are more elaborate. Talked to an engineer before he passed a way. Saw his map, dont have it, but know a good place to enter one of the main ducts for the sewer. There's so much to explore.  Do you know the building across from here. Abandoned... If you go in on backside, on the second floor, at night.. if you go up, you'll see a window that is unlocked.  You'll need to scale up to it. If you go inside, avoid the transients, down to the bottom basement, there's a big door that was a main access point to the sewer. And a major artery of the sewer. Its very deep. Water is 10 feet deep. If you go exploring the sewers theres much to find. My contacts have told me a little bit. Jaxxen: Any advice to avoid the smells and be able to swim through that?  Garth: In the basement there is a small wooden boat to stay out of the water.  Jaxxen: Do you know what happened to the map? Garth: If I could find that map ... if you sold it to me i'd give 500gold. The engineer had 3 nails cut into his forehead.  Kobalt and Garth then depart.

_Matheris group_

Matheris introduces himself to Jaxxen group and tells Jaxxen that the guy with the order at the fruit store needed something about the BANANA and stays different variations over and over of BANANA. Jaxxen picks it up as a code.  Its then that Matheris notices his coinpouch is missing.  Nathair and Ulysses have been swiped as well.  The orcs are still being obnoxious and tossed a chicken wing behind and it hits a human and they move away to another table. Matheris reiterates that the person wanted to discuss the BANANA.  Matheris returns to his table. Hereist nor Jinxia noticed the halfling that stole his purse, Nathair and Ulysses. Hereist says he hates thieves, wish he knew where to start. Matheris will check with bartender while Jinxia checks around the room. Bartender points direction to other side of halforcs where halfling went. Maybe he went outside? He certainly didnt go in the do not enter door. Owners quarters are upstairs and wouldnt tolerate a thief. Matheris says owner may be getting robbed presently. Thieves are the worst.

_Jaxxen group_

Jaxxen and group will go out north door and will telepathically send message as to whether see or not. Matheris and group to the south. See 3 more half-orcs coming in.  Matheris heading to that alley between Night Owl and Green Dragon. Jaxxen and group crossing Bardhome to stables.  Matheris sees them and he re-enters tavern on Gray Street to check out the orcs. Its getting more louder. On southeastern corner, they are loud and obnoxious and have broken a chair, ordering more ale. Matheris watches a bit and whispers to Jinxia to as best as she can to remain hidden, get past halforcs, and see if door is unlocked in southeast. its locked. Matheris checks southwest side and its locked. Gradually checks the other two doors as subtley as possible and they are also locked. Sees some barbarians on the north side, and a fighter with a big hammer. they seem agitated at halforcs, and starting to walk towards them. Three big guys say halforcs making too much noise. Want them to shut the fuck up. Half orcs say whose gonna make us? Then swords start flying and barfight commences. People backing up.  

Jaxxen crosses Bardhome to Light Street. We see the stablemaster back there.  Talk about getting the BANANAS tucked away. Conversation commences and Jaxxen leaves them in the room with 6 rations.  Then heads back across bardhome on light street to south side entrance of Night Owl. Hear and see the fight going on. OVer a dozen people fighting, some dead. Jaxxen working his way behind fighting avoiding to get hit.  Hereist and Jinxia also making their way but Jaxxen doesnt see her. Jaxen avoids the fiht and steps out. Tavern doors burst open with gash across chest and cut on arm. Hes stumbling and heavily injured. Has a short sword in his hand, which he drops. Jaxxen rushes over and tries to prop him against building. Lots of blood coming through my fingers trying to save him. Half orc stumbles out with axe stuck in his head, hes dead. Jaxxen fails to pull the axe out of his skull.  I see a pouch on his belt. I goto cut the pouch off. Woman asks what im doing.  See some gold, platinum and silver. Dump the coins on his body -- 5pp,  some gold and silver. And i keep the pouch. Bystander tries to help the unconscious guy. He clutches a symbol and prays. The man twitches and picks his head up. and thanks the bystander. Says "you will live". Jaxxen tells the man that there is some coins on the half orc and he could use them to perhaps buy some healing.  The guy grabs his short sword and picks up the coins on the half-orc. Jaxxen gets back to doors, opens occasionally to see whats going on. 4 dead bodies on ground. fighting on other side. bows come out, some arrows flying. some people running out the other side. Matheris past the brawl, but Jinxia is here at the door.  Bartenders screaming, waitresses ducked down behind bar. Archers shooting half orcs that are still alive. Some other ruffians involved. half orc and barbarian sword fighting. Jaxxen makes it past them, close call but ok. I get to Matheris and Hereist, and ask them what they did. Barbarian hits half orc across chest. two arrows fly past half orc and into its right eye. Half orc falls dead, smashing another chair.  Matheris and us can get back to Jinxia. Jinxia unlocks the lock. Jinxia slips in with Matheris following. Hereist doesnt want to get involved in thievery. Jaxxen suggests we stay down here and make sure its safe down here. 

_Matheris group_

Matheris and Jinxia head up stairs .. its dim light. From the outside coming in the doors burst in. 6 city guards come rushing in with swords drawn, and plate armor and pissed off. They yell to stop the fighting. Half orc still swinging. 3 guards instantly stab and kill him. Barbarian backs off and gets on his knees. A guard uses but of sword and hits his stomach and he gets on his knees.  Everyone calming down. Jaxxen and Hereist get outside. There's a wagon that 2 humans came and are trying to load on the street. The healed human is gone. Jaxxen and Hereist help lift the half orc onto the wagon. The guys warn about some guilds in the area and the danger. Hereist looks like a good guy. The guy just tells us there's some guilds either fightin themselves or stealin and killing people. Jaxxen asks about the inner city. But they dont work there. Only the very wealthy get in there.  Guards are bringing out dead bodies helping load on the cart. About 5 dead bodies on top. Horse pulling cart.  Another brawl, another haul.  Jaxxen and Hereist go back inside to the door blocking so it doesnt just open. Wait for guards to take people out and they disperse everyone. The people that were fighting and still alive are leaving the tavern.  The gaurds leave as well on some horses. Jaxxen asks bartender if he knows anything about the guilds but he says not to speak of it. Jaxxen pays for a round of drinks around the bar. And the bar was cheering. 

Matheris and Jinxia.. sees big bedroom and statues.  Looking for halflings hiding in there that may be gold and shiny. Jinxia hears something in an armoire. Signals to Matheris "shh" and point at it, and then her ear. She draws rapier and Matheris draws sword. Two big doors on armoire. Drawers in the bottom. Matheris looks into keyhole. As he gets closer, door is kicked open by a halfling. He's got the drop on Matheris with a hand crossbow. hits. got a dagger in other hand swinging also. hits for 4 and 4. Scrambling to left to get away. Jinxia tries to stab him, hits for 10. Matheris rushes after halfling, swung and missed. Halfling throws dagger at Jinxia. Daggers thrown, some misses. Jinxia attacks again with rapier, misses. Matheris downs a healing potion for 10. Other healing potion in chest. Matheris sees a bald headed human, diving for the halfling but misses.  Halfling throws a dagger and misses. Jinxia rapiers and kills the halfling. Bald guy pulls a rapier demanding to know what was going on. Matheris tries to explain what was happening and that they were killing the thief to prevent further damage. The man examines the body to make sure he hasn't stolen anything. Jinxia got one pouch without him noticing.  Matheris gets some of the pouches back and will dispose of the halfling body.  Matheris then tells hes a bard and could offer his services.  The old man went from upset and angry to calmed down and shakes his hand.  His name is Diego.  Guy offers 3 gold to play some songs this evening for the customers. Tells his name and that of Jinxia. He tells that he owns the Oreo Inn on the other side. says to tell James at the inn, that Diego said if you need rooms its on him. The inn is just next door to the west. He finds some caltrops on the halfling, a hand crossbow with 6 bolts, one dagger and 710gp, 51pp, 20ep, 117sp, 53cp. Jinxias had 205gp. Nothing special about clothes but has nice thieves tools.

_regrouped_

Jaxxen and Matheris dispose of the thief in a trash can outide.

Jaxxen tries to start a chant to rile up the crowd with drinks 

```
NIGHT OWL, DONT TOLERATE FOUL!
GET YOUR DRINK ON, OR GET OUT NOW!
SIT DOWN, AND ENJOY A MEAL
DONT EVEN THINK OF TRYING TO STEAL!
THERE REALLY IS NO NEED TO FIGHT
WHEN THERES ENOUGH FOOD AND ALE TO LAST ALL NIGHT!
```


Matheris gets setup to play some bardic tunes. Tells the tales, and we all get drinks. Jinxia hiding in the corners. We all get drinks. People come up thanking for the mood. Matheris makes 5sp as he works the crowd. Matheris tells Jaxxen about The Oreo Inn next door is owned by Diego upstairs and we could get rooms talking to James. Matheris bids the bartender good night and hopes to see the crowd again soon.  We decide to head over to the Oreo Inn while still traffic on the streets. We exit on Light Street side, still people out. Oreo Inn next door. Seems decent.

Guy at front desk. Matheris talks to him about the rooms and that Diego sent us. Sets us up with 2 rooms, numbers 4 and 5. Interior rooms on the ground floor. We group in room #4 to talk plans. Jaxxen and Matheris recount the days events and the folks at the stables have food for a few days.

Jaxxen will attempt to attune to the ring, with on left hand. Concentrating on it between fingers. Thinking about the vision.  The ring fits on my wedding ring finger. Dont feel like its attuned just yet. And then turning on my finger. About 45 minutes of time there seems a little tingle, but dont feel completely there. The tingling seems that it comes from the symbol. With right hand feeling around wrist with the symbol.  Jaxxen leaves the ring on.

Jinxia taking first watch, Hereist working on sharpening sword.  Next day comes. Walls are thick, so was a quiet night. No events.  We all regroup, check out of the Oreo and head to the Night Owl to see if they have any breakfast. We have chicken wings for breakfast. Matheris gives Hereist a pouch of 200gp and he pays for breakfast.

Matheris and Jinxia will go to Duck and Cover stables. Jaxxen and Hereist to the general store south of the candle shop.

Matheris sees different stablemaster today. and checks up on companions

Jaxxen has a shopping list that he wants to pick up

```
signal whistle (5cp each) 
chalk (1cp each, get a few)
bells (1gp each, get 2)
case for a map or scroll (1gp, 1 lb)
healing potions (50gp, .5 lb)
oil flasks

```

Hereist  buys hooded lantern + 3 flasks + signal whistle + 1 bell + backpack + sack
Jaxxen   buys 6 bells (3gp), some string to hang the bells (2sp), signal whistle (5cp), 6 chalk (6cp), waterproof case for paper (1gp)

Jaxxen recommends that Matheris buy a mirror for visual signaling.

Some workers in the alley. Building behind general store not sure what it is. Doors and color of building seems to match Gneeral store. Inside the general store we ask about the building and shopkeep says its where they keep extra inventory.

To the east of Phoenix Mount Inn is a Church
-- church diety unknown.
Next building unknown but one after that is another church.
Behind the Dapper Dragon is a factory but dont know what they build. That whole row is factories that makes things
East of the tailor not sure what it is.

We explore around light street

When we get to the church, its a lawful good church. they have some healing potions and holy water. regular healing potions for 50gp each.  Some of us buy 1 or 2 healing potions of the 8 they had availble. Matheris also buys some holy water.

We make note of several of the buildings and properties.
A few churches on Barley Street, one building is burned, and theres a graveyard behind there.

We saw two statues near the door of Zorch

Decide to go in the alleys and check the backside of the old abandoned building.. Definitely a place we dont really want to be there at night.

In the back of Zorch, there's organized trash..

We do see manhole covers fairly often scattered, some in the alleys, some on the streets.

Alleys are quieter but disgusting.

We see a fellow in the alley, we ask him about *Zorch*. He doesnt know. But heard it was a man in the arcane arts.

Jaxxen asks him his name.. he says a lot of people call him Orga. Pleasure to meet you, my name is Patrick. Orga keeps looking at Jaxxen.
Matheris keeps an eye on the guy who walks up to the north. The buiding behind Zorch .. not sure what it is. Has multiple doors, three stories. has a lot of windows, but all window shades are closed. Jinxia notices that someone is looking out of 2nd story at us from that building.
