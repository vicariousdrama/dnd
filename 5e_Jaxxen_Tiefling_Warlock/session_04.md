## Day 8 (afternoon/evening)

Matheris, before turning on Owl street for inn and stables, there was a vendor near there that had some unusual items, a bowl of bird heads, bowl of feathers, ground up silver, silver shavings. Was able to determine couple items, sold some things...

Guy is an alchemist of such. Did some trading, sold his baselisk egg, identified potion Matheris had in stainless steel vial, a top end healing potion that he sold. And he bought some spell components so he can do identify by  himself. His name was Pulk. After negotiating and selling egg and flask, 4d6+10 healing, sold. Good contact.

Nathair is an old dragonborn, doesnt fit in with the city, and is kind of a night of the woods and thats where he met Ulysses.
Ulysses not afraid of Nathair and has his back. Nathair has a horse, considering stabling his horse. Ulysses talks about the spiders in arachnid forest

The group approaches

Jaxxen disguised like a human commoner.  Ulysses introduces Nathair to the group. Jaxxen says any friend of Ulysses is a friend of mine.
Talks of going to Drunken Goblin Tavern, Matheris has sung about it. 3 floors, very large, extremely popular and rowdy. Can get dwarven ales, meads and stouts and elvish wine for sure.

Nathair recounts how he has amnesia and doesnt remember anything before the monks took him in. And later is when he met Nathair

Nathair fairly tall..6 foot, an older Dragonborn with long neck that stoops with age and wearing a dark grey cloak to cover himself.

Matheris asks Nathair how he handles himself in a fight. Nathair has a long sword, could go alone down another hallway?  Nathair down a third way.
Blow a whistle, yell, or roar if anything goes wrong.
Sewer made of stonework. Small stone. Ulysses takes a dart from pack and uses Nathair crowbard to hammer it in. Matheris plans to hang a lantern, tells group to turn back when cant see light anymore. They briefly consider writing note on a card but pass and begin heading out.

Theres a slight bit of wind down the tunnels, blows the torches some, but not blowing them out, just flickering here and there. With torches and lantern it lights well where they are at. Its very stinky, nasty water on the bottom.

- Left: Ulysses and Hereist
- Straight: Nathair
- Right: Matheris and Jinxia

Jinxia hops on Matheris back, basically blind without any light.

_Jaxxen_

Jaxxen casts Armor of Agathys for shielding. See a smaller tunnel to the right or main to the right. See footprints into smaller tunnel. Crouching down head right into the tunnel. Going further, see a light ahead. Stationary. slowly approaching sewer walls with cloak around me. 

_Matheris group_

Ulysses and Hereist hear something walking towards them. Asks the fighter his name again. He whispers "Its Hereist." Should we go back? Ulysses thinks we should hide and go down tunnel. Hereist claims his armor is loud.

Nathair was going straight. Gets to a door like the last, grates on bottom to let sewer water underneath. Tries the door. Its locked. He tries opening after looking for traps. Doesnt see any and the door is unlocked and opens.

Matheris and Jinxia had gone to the right. Matheris sees small tunnels, foot in diameter, every 10 feet, like feeder sewer lines. 

_Jaxxen_ 

Jaxxen getting to a light. Path goes in three directions. Past a door. Stationary light just around corner to left. Going to the left. See a lantern, held by a dart driven into the mortar. Yells "Is anybody down here?" and notices straight ahead and to the left a dim light. Listen intensely and wait.

_Matheris group_

Ulysses and Hereist hears what was behind them is moving faster.

Nathair barely sees lantern, its getting dim. He decides to turn around.

Matheris and Jinxia barely sees the lantern. Up ahead see another metal ladder to a manhole. Begins heading back to meeting point.

Ulysses and hereist hears running behind them. Hereist is already into a stride with his long sword out and shield in left hand. See an arrow zip by both of them and hear a growling gnarly voice. Dashing towards lantern.

_Jaxxen_

Jaxxen hears something coming from left side. Aims down, steadied at corner as coverage. See Ulysses and Hereist running like mad towards me running for their life.

_Matheris group_

Nathair coming back, lantern visiblity getting brighter.

Matheris and Jinxia heading back. They see lantern getting closer and see another light on opposite side, closer to lantern than you are. See it moving all over the place, moving erratically. Yells out.

_regrouped_

Jaxxen yells back to Matheris that saw Ulysses and Hereist running towards.

Ulysses and Hereist is rushing.

Matheris says he has a plan, lets get wounded first

Jaxxen sees a horned thing with tails, and sharped claw feet, muscular, kinda small, fit in sewer area, like a kobold. Cant determine how many there are.

Late afternoon, early evening, getting dark.  We're still looking for Drunken Goblin Tavern. Have talked to people who point us in the right direction.  But we'll get there after ark. Drunken Goblin is just an tavern, but theres other inns and stables nearby. Its basically a lively street.
We hear loud noises coming from main street. People out everywhere. Loud music . All the sudden see a three story building, massive, out front says Drunken Goblin Tavern. Line from front door all the way from front and along side of it. and Lots of security at entrance.

We find Duck and Cover stables nearby. Human stablemaster. Says its 1gp per animal. Jaxxen pays for the 4 animals.

There is an inn called the Crowbar Inn. There's a crow perched on the rim of a mug on the sign.  Get doubles rooms

- Room 1: Nathair and Ulysses
- Room 2: Matheris and Jinxia
- Room 3: Jaxxen with Hereist 

Drunken Goblin.. a few half orc guards, some human barbarians, with two handed weapons, short swords on side, long swords, big heavy axe etc.  Jaxxen wants to check perimeter.  There's a female in purple robe, has mysterious look, unusual eyes, looking around at everything. Stands and looks at everyone entering. First floor has no windows at all. On second and third there are windows. On third are lots of lights amplifying out, much more than second. Around the back of the building one exit point and 9 heavily armed guards on back door. Some have fullplate, some chainmail, halberds, two handed axe, etc. Dont see any other doors except for these. See less windows in back. Two on second and third floor in back. Sides and front has more windows.

We get in line but watch the entrance.

Across the street, another 3 story building ,see humanoid figures that have bows or crossbows. Not sure if they are guards for the drunken goblin tavern or something else.

As we get closer, they turned away someone with a hooded robe. Was a male human. Pulls out 2 daggers, and he has a gnarly face, agitated. Eyes glowing. On his daggers there is liquid flowing down daggers. They tell him to get the fuck out of here. He gets up and leaves. Across road on 3 story building, have bows drawn, and aiming at the man that was turned away. He leaves into the alley.

As we get closer, see a sign that says "Fuck around and find out"

This is a rough group of individuals.  Jaxxen chooses to stay appearing as a tiefling. We get to the guards. They are patting people down. There's a cover charge 1gp per person. 
Matheris gets checked, and he pays his gold after getting through. Jinxia is fine as well. Jaxxen gets examined. He's not worried about anything. Pays gold and enters.

Guard opening double doors letting us in. Heavy metal doors. Kinda squeeky. Inside is smokey a bit, thumpin heavy. Never been in a tavern this lively before.  Its huge 10000 square feet, so many tables, large bars on either side, magical effects at the stage, mosh pit, womens scantily clad,etc.

We stay grouped together and work our way to the bar on the left. Its being run with a female tiefling.
Grab a barstool, Jinxia on lower rung. Matheris sitting.
Bards up on stage. In back, theres a male and female playing to the same tune, but makes room like surround sound. 
Matheris pays for a round of drinks, Jaxxen pays for a round as well.  There's a lot of smoke up at the ceiling.  As we get more acclimated, around smaller stages there are some card table games. There's dice games as well. Every now and then someone gets upset, but no fights.  Matheris looks for a low stakes table. Sees a silver piece table.  We sit at the table.

_Jaxxen_

Jaxxen stays behind at the table. Convinces that he isn't part of them.

_Matheris and Jinxia_

Door at kitchen says Do not enter. Inside there is a place with a cage and a lock on it. Like a small jail cell. Guard tells Matheris to get in. Matheris tries to persuade the guard to just let them leave the guard tonight.  Guard pushes Matheris and Jinxia into the cage. Locks the cage. Says they'll be in there for a few hours.   Theres another guy laying there drunk in the corner. Smell on em. passed out. In another cell a pretty rough character with black robes and tattoos.  Matheris asks what the other guy is in for. He says "murder". Says some guy was in his way. Jinxia is subtly searching the passed out dude to see if anything in his pockets. Old man farts really loud and stinks really bad. Jinxia finds some components for something, and two platinum pieces.  Old man wakes to, asks what Jinxia is doing. Its Otto! Matheris: Thought you were dead, smell like you took a shit! Did you ever take that shit? Otto: I take shits all the time, something i gotta live with. Matheris: why you in jail?

Bartender warns about a man in brown robes, to watch him hes dangerous, killed someone. I thank him for his warning. I check around and see the stairs, its VIP access. Jaxxen tries to get through, and claims his name but the guy doesnt recognize and turns me away.. I listen a bit and realize. I go to the other guard and cnvince him I'm Gerico on the list, but he only sees Geico.  

Jaxxen convinces thats his name and its spelled wrong. Jaxxen heads up the steps.  Comes to a door. Another guard welcoming me in. Inside this room is mirror image of bottom facing opposite direction. stage on opposite end. floor is carpet. real pretty designs. more up class. more pleasant. Jaxxen mingles about to overhear any interesting conversations.. hear some wealthy people, could be nobles, jewelry attire and clothes well off. Within earshot hear there has been an uprising at the inner city. As time goes on, hear about..used to be no king, was a free city. someone stepped in proclaimed themself as king with small army to be in such position. one of the nobles said one of them fucking casket nails killed him. next thing you kow they were dragging him through the streets with 23 arrows in his body and someone put a tattoo on his forehead of casket nails. talking about doing away with the entry tax.

Cells are adjacent to the other one with the murderer. Matheris tries starting a dice game. The guy will play for silver. Otto says sure, why not.  Old man sits down

They gamble amongst themselves for a bit. Guards come in and throw someone else in the cell. They have his arms tied behind his back, and they tie him to the bars. Hes banging his head on the bars.

Jaxxen is curious... Calls the wait staff over to top up this groups glasses. Introduces himself as Gerico. And then says I couldnt help but overhear your discussions into the Casket Nails and the deposed king. The Casket Nails sounds like quite a strong group of people wouldnt you say?

Gwinn: "Thanks for the drinks. ... its been an interesting time in the inner city"

Jaxxen asks some more questsions

- Jaxxen: Why won't the city guards expel them?
  - Gwinn: Most people around say its the most dangerous guild of nostr, an assassin guild, very dangerous, they have no mercy
- Jaxxen: Have you ever seen any of them yourself?
  - Gwinn: We thought we were going to be able to capture one but they killed him before hand. they killed their own person so they wouldnt be ratted out. They are called the casket nails. They all have a tatoo somewhere on their body of nails. like three nails somewhere. They killed the temporary king. 
- Jaxxen: Heard of any other groups like them?
  - Gwinn: There are other guilds. I dont know there names. Thieves are thieves. Wish there were none but the city brings all sorts.
- Jaxxen: What brings you... to the Drunken Goblin Tavern?
  - Gwinn: We like to get out and mingle a little bit. 

There's several pretty half elf girls in a seated circular booth. drinking fine fluted glasses. 

  - Gwinn: We like to have a little fun here.
- Jaxxen: Where else would you hang out then? 

Jaxxen tells the stories of the spiders encountered. The girls and the well off guys are enthralled with the story. would be terrifying. I bet bards would tell tales of it.

They mention Damus here is an exceptional bard playing and singing great with magical effects

Jaxxen indicates that its interesting to see what the commoners downstairs are doing from time to time but ruckus

The conversation indicates there is another way in that is calmer. They are drinking expensive wine. Each round its 6 gp. They are a little inebriated as well.

After more hours of talking they live in inner city and have political discussions. it has its own wall, they talk of things and there have been a  number of incidents in certain parts of town and sewers have been dangerous. One of it says "i better call it a night" and the girl that was with him gets up. They go towards the stairwell, but instead go to mirror that is a revolving door. They push on edge of mirror. it rotates 360 degrees. They are on the other side. 

Jaxxen then tells the group that he needs to leave and enters the mirror. Theres a passage down to the back on a spiral down, and up to the top. Jaxxen takes spiral stairs down, ornate decorative carpet stairs. On ground level. What appars to be a door. Theres another guard down here. Hes not concerned about me. Hes tired. Jaxxen goes through the door to the outside. Its an alleyway, behind me looks like there isn't even a door here at all. On distance both sides of alley there are guards. Jaxxen sees the guy that left straight ahead about 50 feet with his lady. He has a guard with him.  Jaxxen doesnt see the door he came out of, its like a secret entrance.  Walk down alley toward front of building. Alleys are clean. Hear music from the building. I get to the front of the place. Guard looks at me, walks towards me.  Jaxxen heads towards the direction guard was pointing to where the wealthy man went. Narrow alley. It comes to a nice pretty door. Very ornate iron handle. Pretty statues. Back of a building. Jaxxen tries to open the door. It opens to a building thats fairly empty. Velvet curtains on front are closed. Walk around small wall that says Closed on front door. One room small building. Looking outside see someone hanging around on outside of door. Doesnt look armed. Maybe trying to blend in. Jaxxen periodically checking what the guy does. Then Jaxxen hears the back door open up. Another couple approaching. Jaxxen shows them the gentlemen out there. Ask what hes doing there. They indicate hes friendly. Jaxxen says he must have had too much tonight. They open the door. He greets them. Jaxxen steps outside and is greeted. After a brief conversation, departs and heads on street to the left and another left to main road of Drunken Goblin. Pass the guards that seen on alleyway on left of building.  Jaxxen heads back to the inn. Talks to Hereist and describes what happened with Matheris and Jinxia. Hereist and Jaxxen heads back to DGT. They get in line and its shortern now, about 2:30 in the morning but louder than ever. Guards dont take any crap. Most checked over and pay their gold and get in. Hereist and Jaxxen get entry to DGT. Magical effects from the bards and all playing in synch and everything. tons of beautiful and ugly women. Jaxxen shows Hereist where the dice table was and we end up talking to some guards to try to find out where they  take people.

_Matheris and Jinxia_

Matheris does short rest with Jinxia and he does his bardic stuff to improve healing as well.

Guards open up and bring in some dwarves. See the guy dead and asks what happened. Matheris says the guy attacked him and they had to defend themselves. Matheris pleas and asks if can get out of here. Dwarf face all bloodied. Guard punches him in face and he gets knocked unconscious. Then locks the cell. Guards slam the main door and leave. Other guy in cell fighting two drunk dwarves. Jinxia looks over knocked out dwarves possessions. 

Matheris takes off his belt to try to wrap around a dwarf if comes over. Fails.

Hooded robe guy stabs dwarves. Hes getting bloodied.

Jinxia finds small hammer like a jewelers hammer, 3gp, 11sp. Ornate hammer. Kind of fancy.  Shows to Matheris. He doesnt know and Jinxia puts it back. THey look at the hooded cloaked frenemy.

Hooded robe guy stabs another dwarf. Bloodied and killed em both.

- Matheris: What brings you to this tavern?
  - Hooded guy: To relax and unwind. Been trying to get to the second floor, dont know how. and i know theres' a third floor.
- Matheris: What do yu do for a living?
  - Hooded guy: nothin really. just a drifter.
- Matheris: Fair enough, me too, traveler and seeker of tales
  
They wish they could get out. Jinxia begins picking the lock. fails. Hooded character asks if he can try. Jinxia worried she'll be double crossed, but the man promises. Hooded guy gets it unlocked on his. Opens it. Starts to walk out and plans to walk out and leave them there. He smiles and comes back. He saw the keys somewhere. He cant find and tries to pick their lock and is successful. He asks Jinxia if she would be willing to sell her tools. Had his taken away earlier. Jinxia hesitates and says they were given to her by her mother. Hooded guy doesnt have enough to buy. Jinxia asks his name. He doesnt usually doesnt give it out. He says its Mercan. Asks where they could find him again if find some work or interesting situations.  He mentions a place down at the harbor. Theres a place down at the harbor. Help one of the the harbor masters.. do some work there. Look for common Little Red Dragon Inn can find me sometimes if im not here at the Drunken Goblin.

- Matheris:  despite killin someone they let you back in eh? 
  - Mercan: yeah.. i dont think we'll ahve any trouble.

He takes his hooded robe off completely, throws to the side. I cant be in black robes i'll be picked off easily.  

- Matheris: Think they'll even notice we're gone?

Matheris walks over and shuts cell doors.

- Mercan: Im gonna get out of here. if they catch me im a dead man.

He exits, and tries to blend in and shift around dodging guards. Then he has a red cape on that he swiped. Then hes blending in even more. and hes off in the distance.

Matheris and Jinxia slip out as well trying to blend in. Going to just act like a drunken fellow. Back at stage he sees a bard going up stage with his instrument and looks at Matheris asking if playing tonight.  Matheris says he needs better attire for a performance. He gets a change of clothes back there. Finds some decorative pants, matching shirt. Have to leave armor sitting somewhere.

_Jaxxen and Hereist_

Jaxxen and Herist talk to the guards to find out where they throw people in the back that are problematic. Then head up towards the stage area. See skinny old man we know with a walking stick. See Otto. I rush with Hereist over towards Otto. Otto was fixin to go up the steps to the 2nd floor. Jaxxen motions to Otto, Hey how are you. Jaxxen whispers to Otto that we're looking for Matheris and Jinxia in holding cells. Otto tells us about Jinix and matheris able to escape and Otto going to head to the 2nd floor. Jaxxen says he wants to get reunited with Matheris and Jinxia and says that hes been to the second floor as well. Then the curtains rise and next set is setting up and Matheris is there. Otto points them out and Jaxxen in complete shock.  

Otto heads back to second floor and jaxxen watches Matheris

Otto heads to guard talks a bit and heads up stairs.

Matheris playing his heart out on stage with the other bards.

Jaxxen gets drinks with Hereist to enjoy the show and wait for Matheris. A little halfling female comes up and tries to strike a conversation. and offers to buy a drink. large chested lady comes over. Halfling buys a round for us. Jaxxen asks her what her name is. She says its Telina. Asks if shes here by herself, and she says friend is in the back. In trouble, has someone after him. Someone wanting to kill him.  Hes in the front of room with someone that wants to hurt him. Shes offering 10gp. But she wont talk to the guards thinks they cant get to him in time.  Jaxxen asks her to lead us to where this is. 

Toward front small stage, there's a male halfling, sitting there at table. Table cloth over table and across from him is a big guy. Hands of big guy aren't completely visible. Says thats friend Bren, hes a halfling. That man is wanting to kill him. Please, i'll pay you.

Jaxxen looks to see if anyone else with the big guy.

Hes standing up folded and crossed. flanking. also looking at the halfling.

Jaxxen sends telepathic message to halfling that hes here to help and get ready to run.

Jaxxen then gets mirror and tries to reflect it into the guys eyes. Cast Thaumaturgy and brighten the light.  Try to reflect the light but fail miserably. Light goes back to normal.

I walk to table to see if i can tlak to him. Guy standing arms come down takes a step forward. Guy at table asks what i want, I telepathically say "now", and i tell the guy there's someone important that wants to see you. Short sword. Halfling tried to dive but got cut hurt. Guy with crossed arms going for halfling.
roll initiative

Matheris finishes his set. he talked to head of entertainment named Selena. Flamboyant elf with purple puffy clothes and feather. Wrote his name down as a backup. Then he gets jinxia puts his armor back on. they avoid guards, try to get to bar to grab a drink. Matheris gets elven wines for him and jinxia. they sip and socialize the way to the front.

Jaxxen puts a dagger to the guy's crotch sitting. sword guy draws and jaxxen says look down. Guy tells him to wait. then Jaxxen says I said there was someone important that wanted to see you. Head to the back, tell the guards your name is Jared and they'll let you up the stairs. The guy asks who? Jaxxen says I think you know who. The guy says "Jake?". 

At this point Matheris and Jinxia join. We explain briefly what happened. Hereist puts down his glass after drinking and we all head out of the Drunken Goblin.

Number of guards outside. 330 to 4am in the morning. As we go out. Halflings had ducked right across the street into a tavern across the street. We decide to pursue them into the tavern called 

### The Bottomless Goblet

There's no cover to get in or a guard. We hear music playing inside. Nothing out of the ordinary.

When we get in, see lot of light moving around, bard up on stage. Much smaller place. Playing quite well. About 30 people here cheering him on.  

Jaxxen: The guys name is Bren, we should ask if anyone's seen them.

Jinxia goes to dark corner, while Matheris talks to barkeep. Jaxxen goes to check the back to see if he can find Telina or Bren.  A guy comes around and asks if I need a room. And I say now and want to see the guest list which he refuses but reveals that yes, Telina and Bren stay there but he wont reveal their rooms. Jaxxen orders an ale and hangs out there looking for Telina and Bren.

Matheris talks to the barkeep looking for sidework. and asks if seen Bren who got hurt. Barkeep says they came in got an ale and went upstairs. Matheris offers to do some healing. The barkeep says to talk to the man over by the rooms where tiefling (jaxxen) is talking. Matheris tries to convince the guy to send a message to the halflings that he can heal them. An elf comes around the corner. The man has the elf give a message to the halflings. They didnt want to come down. Jaxxen sees Telina popping around the corner

Jaxxen telephatically sends a message "Dont mean to hurt you, just want you to make good on the deal".

Telina comes down, pulls out a pouch and offers the pouch. 

_Matheris_

Matheris asks if hes ok.  Telina been tending to his wounds. Matheris offers to heal. Telina has no more gold. Telina got his bleeding to stop. Jaxxen asks if he should join. Matheris suggests to stay and watch the door. Telina leads Matheris to room (212). Its a deep cut. Matheris heals for 4 and Bren thanks him. Telina hugs Bren and then Matheris.

_Jaxxen and Jinxia_

The guys from DGT come in.

Jaxxen notices and changes appearance to be like a half-elf.  They guys talk to the bartender.  Man mentions halflings says a teifling was asking
