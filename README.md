# dnd

This repository will contains character sheets and possibly notes for DND campaigns.
The intention is to have an easy way to share my character sheets with others, and leverage git for tracking changes over time.

[Jaxxen the Tiefling Warlock](5e_Jaxxen_Tiefling_Warlock/) is currently involved in an adventure with Matheris the Bard and Jinxia the Rogue, heading to Nostr city.  The readme in that folder contains session notes of progression thus far.

[Henry the Half-Elf Paladin](5e_Henry_Half-Elf_Paladin.pdf) is a backup character not yet in play.
